 * The microphone level, with the line speech has to cross drawn on it.

 * The threshold marker is the point. A bare level bar answers "is audio arriving", which was never
 * really in doubt; what a user actually needs when nothing is being transcribed is "am I loud
 * enough", and that is only answerable against the number the VAD compares to. Both come from the
 * same measurement in the worklet, so the bar and the decision cannot disagree.
 *
 * Both widths arrive from the store as CSS percentages — the scale factor is a property of how loud
 * speech is, and belongs next to the numbers rather than in a template.
 *
 * ## Why this is named
 *
 * Named as a part because a template that supplies its own transcript panel otherwise loses the
 * answer to "is it hearing me". That is the one question a transcript cannot answer for itself: an
 * utterance takes seconds to buffer, transcribe and write, so a panel showing only saved lines is
 * indistinguishable from a broken microphone for the whole of that delay.
 *
 * The workshop template used to be that consumer, and its copy of the panel never placed this — so
 * the interface built around recording a meeting said *less* about a failing microphone than the
 * default one did. It places the whole panel now, which is the better answer to a shared piece; the
 * part stays for the interface that genuinely wants a different arrangement.
 *
 * No `subject`. Unlike the feed, this is about the microphone *this agent* is running right now,
 * which is a property of the session and not of any call record — pointing it at another call
 * would be pointing a live meter at something that is not being measured.
 */
/**
 * How everything about the microphone arrives and leaves: a fade, and deliberately never a reveal.
 *
 * A fade changes only opacity, so the element holds its box throughout — which is the whole point in
 * both directions. Reveal animates the height instead, and the height is the thing that must not
 * move while anything else is on screen changing.
 *
 * ## Leaving
 *
 * Leaving a call takes the meter, the coverage readout and the section around them away at once, and
 * the placeholder underneath is mid-fade at that moment: the renderer keeps an outgoing branch
 * mounted for the length of its exit, so the sentence was still painted when the space above it
 * vanished, and slid up the panel while transparent. This is longer than the placeholder's own exit,
 * so the order is the sentence finishing, then the height going, with nothing visible left to move.
 *
 * ## Arriving
 *
 * The same string, for symmetry and for a real reason. Without an explicit `enterTransition` the
 * renderer sets opacity straight to 1 in the effect, with no painted start value to interpolate
 * from — so whether anything actually faded depended on whether this box had been shown before,
 * which is not a difference anybody chose. Declared, it always fades.
 *
 * Nothing about the reflow changes either way: the box claims its space the moment it renders,
 * transparent or not, so what this decides is only whether the contents appear or resolve.
 *
 * All three levels carry it. The section's own fade holds nothing if the meter and the readout have
 * already unmounted from inside it, and those two answer to different facts — the readout to a
 * microphone existing, the meter to recording — so each has to hold its own height.

 * set of readouts rather than a meter and then a warning. It states the count either way and only
 * changes *colour* when there is a gap: a number that appears when something is wrong is a number
 * nobody learns to read, and "4 of 4" is worth seeing precisely because it means the record is whole.

      line below about only those microphones reaching the record. Both resolved before anybody
      could read them, and the line arriving and then leaving moved everything under it twice.

      A delayed fade was tried first and made it worse. `$animate` keeps its child mounted and a
      fade only touches opacity, so the readout reserved its full height while invisible: the panel
      opened a hole, sat on it, and then filled it in. Nothing about *when it is drawn* can fix a
      readout that should not be there at all.

      `available` is the honest test, because it separates the two states that look alike. No audio
      means the session is still coming up, and there is nothing to report yet. Audio with no
      recording is a decision — somebody pressed stop, or auto-join is off — and that is exactly

      the record without any microphone hearing it — so the sentence overstated the gap it was
      warning about, in a panel that offers the very thing it forgot.

      The count already carries the warning. It turns from `success-text` to `warning-text` when
      somebody is not being transcribed, which is the whole signal; a sentence appearing underneath
      to explain a number is the kind of chrome people stop reading before the day it matters. That

/**
 * Suggestions the backend staged instead of writing, and the controls that resolve them.
 *
 * Only appears when there are any, which is *not* always: a value is staged rather than written only
 * where a human already owns one, so a pass that only *creates* records leaves this empty. That is
 * the right default — a permanently empty "0 pending" box teaches people to stop looking at the
 * place their attention is eventually needed.
 *
 * ## Why it scrolls, and why that is not a `maxHeight`
 *
 * It used to be a plain column beside the panel's one scroll area, and a long call filled the panel
 * with it: a `Column` cannot shrink below its content unless it is told it may, so flexbox took the
 * whole deficit out of the results list underneath — which collapsed to nothing while the review
 * list ran off the bottom. `minHeight: '0'` is what makes this section shrinkable at all; the scroll
 * area inside it is then what the shrinking does. A pixel cap would have been a guess about a panel
 * whose height is the reader's to choose.
 *
 * ## A grid, because a card is not a paragraph
 *
 * `minChildWidth` rather than a column: widening the panel used to stretch each card to the full
 * width, which for four fields of a task is a strip of text with a button at the end of it. The
 * cards reflow into two and three abreast as the lane grows, and back to one in a narrow dock, with
 * no breakpoint to get wrong.
 *
 * ## Still `we-alert`
 *
 * The look is unchanged and deliberately so — `appearance: 'accent'` is a plain surface with a thick
 * status edge, which is what stops a run of these reading as a stack of brown rectangles in a dark
 * theme. It also keeps the warning glyph, which is what makes the state readable to somebody who
 * cannot tell the colours apart. What changed is only what is *inside* it.
 *
 * ## Editing, which this used to refuse
 *
 * The old note here said editing a suggestion is authoring and belongs to whatever normally edits
 * that record. That was true when the only thing staged was a single field of a record somebody
 * already owned. It stopped being true when a pass began proposing whole records: the reviewer is
 * then looking at the only surface that will ever show it *as a suggestion*, and sending them
 * somewhere else to fix a wrong title means keeping something known to be wrong, or discarding a
 * record that was mostly right.

                            `we-alert` always draws one — it has no way to be told not to, and that
                            is deliberate: its own note points at WCAG 1.4.1, which asks that colour
                            never be the only thing carrying a status. A glyph per card is how a
                            single alert earns that.

                            A *grid* of them is the case the rule was not written for. Eight cards
                            with eight identical warning triangles says one thing eight times, and
                            the triangles crowd the title they sit beside. Nothing is left relying on
                            colour alone either way: the heading above says "Awaiting your call" in
                            words, which is the whole meaning of the edge, and every card on screen
                            sits under it.

                            The edge itself is `we-alert`'s `accent` appearance written out: a
                            surface, ordinary text, and a three-pixel rule in the status at full
                            strength rather than in its tint. Same figures, so a card here and an
                            alert elsewhere still look like the same family.

/**
 * What a pass will look for, and the switch for each — the models, not a fixed sentence.
 *
 * It read "Find the tasks and events in what was said", which was true while those two classes were
 * compiled into this module and is a lie in a space that defined its own. These chips both say what
 * will be looked for and let a call narrow it, so the sentence becomes a lead-in rather than
 * something to rewrite every time a community adopts a model.
 *
 * ## One list, not two
 *
 * `extractionTargets` is already the union: every model this space may extract, each flagged with
 * whether this call is looking for it. So "what is on" and "what could be added" are one row of
 * chips rather than a list of pills and a search behind a button — which would be two surfaces that
 * have to agree, over a set that is a handful of entries.
 *
 * ## The state is said in colour, not in opacity
 *
 * An off chip is muted; it is not faded. Reduced opacity is what a *disabled* control looks like,
 * and these are the opposite of disabled — an unselected chip is the one thing on the row you are
 * most likely to want to press. The same confusion had the card's own action buttons fading with
 * the card they sat on.
 *
 * ## What a press actually changes
 *
 * A **group** decision recorded beside the call, not a private preference: the standing watch is one
 * registration the whole neighbourhood shares, so per-agent lists would have peers overwriting each
 * other's in a loop. It does not touch the space's own default, which is a community setting with
 * its own screen. And it applies to what is said from *here on*, because a watch keeps a
 * processed-turn cursor — which is why the panel's help says pressing Extract is how the rest of
 * the conversation gets swept, and the button's own tooltip says it reads the whole thing.
 *
 * ## No lead-in
 *
 * This opened with a sentence — "Look through what was said for:" in a call, "This space's calls
 * look for:" outside one — telling apart two lists that look identical. It was the third line of
 * prose in a box whose job is two controls, and the distinction it drew is already drawn: outside a
 * call the chips are disabled and a link to the space's default appears under them. What a chip
 * *is* went into the panel's help, which is read once and then costs nothing.
 *
 * ## Why this is named
 *
 * An interface that supplies its own extraction panel otherwise has no way to say what is being
 * extracted or to change it — the workshop template had exactly that gap. Registered so placing it
 * is naming it. No `subject`: what a call extracts is a fact about the call being recorded.

          What a call can extract is whatever this space has models for, and until now the panel

          one, and the only mention of where that list comes from was a link that appeared solely
          where the chips could not be pressed. So the answer to "why is the thing I want not here"
          was two screens away and nothing pointed at it.

          Inside the same wrapping row rather than beside it, so it reflows with the chips and sits
          after the last one at any width. Square and outlined: it is one more thing in a row of
          outlined things, and the one that is not a toggle.

          It opens the space's vocabulary rather than doing anything itself. Adding a model is a
          decision about the community, with its own screen and its own wizard, and a panel about
          one call is the wrong place to make it — but exactly the right place to be reminded it can

/**
 * What the passes wrote, for the call on screen — one list, drawn as the suggestions above are.
 *
 * ## One list, not one per kind
 *
 * It grouped by model, with a heading per kind. That came from the shape of the data rather than
 * from anything a reader wanted: a record has a type and `$query` takes one entity name, so a list
 * of mixed kinds is a list of queries, and the groups were those queries showing through. What
 * somebody reviewing a call wants is what the call produced, and each card already says what kind
 * it is.
 *
 * The `$each` over targets stays, because it has to — it is still one subscription per kind. What
 * went is the per-group heading and the space between groups, so the cards run together into a
 * single grid. The one thing this cannot do is interleave: cards come out grouped by kind in the
 * order the targets are listed, because a schema cannot merge a list of queries whose length it
 * does not know, let alone sort across them. Nothing on screen claims otherwise.
 *
 * ## The same card as a suggestion
 *
 * Same kind row, same headline, same detail fields, from the same builders — see `CardShape` for
 * how one definition draws two different shapes of row. What differs is the edge, which is
 * `success` here against the suggestions' `warning`, and the absence of an answer: these are
 * already agreed to, so there is nothing to keep or discard.
 *
 * No pencil either. Editing a suggestion is part of answering it — the store holds a draft that
 * Keep commits — and a record on this list has already been written, so changing one is an ordinary

  What starts a pass automatically, and it is a *call's* decision.

  The space has a standing answer and an administrator sets it; this is the people in the room
  deciding about the room. On the live call only: a meeting somebody opened from a link is not
  happening, so "as it happens" has nothing to be about, and the switch would be asking about a
  conversation that finished. Everything else here follows the call on screen; this one thing
  cannot.

  ## A button that says its state, not a switch

  It was a `we-switch` whose `label` is an aria-label, so on screen it was an unlabelled toggle
  beside an "Extract" button, and nobody could say which of the two did what. A button carries
  its own words. `primary` when on rather than `danger`: red is this interface's word for "your
  microphone is live", a personal state that is its own off switch, and auto extraction is a
  standing decision the whole call shares. Two red buttons in one panel would say one thing about
  two different things.

  ## Under the chips, which is what it is about

  It has been three places. Beside the title, where two labelled buttons plus a glyph is more than
  a `sm` dock is wide and the title gave way first. Then inside the sunken box with the chips, where
  a filled button among outlined ones read as one more toggle. Then in a row above that box, paired
  with Extract now.

  That pairing was the thing worth breaking. The two buttons look alike and are not: one runs a pass
  now, the other decides whether passes happen at all — and the second is a fact *about* the chips
  above it, which is where it now sits. Extract now went to the header, where the transcript panel
  keeps its own verb, so the two are no longer read as a matched pair.

  is the panel one over: the transcript's header carries Transcribe and Continue, which are the two
  things that panel *does*. This is the thing this panel does, so it goes in the same corner — a
  reader moving between the two docked panels finds the verb in one place rather than two.

  happen at all. The second is a fact about the chips and now sits under them.

 * used to end with "Open the graph to see them", which was an errand rather than an answer; the

 * a footnote under the button about what a mid-call change does and does not cover; and the button
 * itself, at the end of the chip row, where an outlined button beside outlined chips read as one

 * inference stopped being true the moment continuing a call adopted its record straight away.
 * Continue a conversation nobody spoke in and Extract went live over nothing. The store cannot do
 * better alone either: peers write into the shared record without telling it, so "is there anything
 * in here" is a question for the graph rather than for this session.
 *
 * One row is the whole answer, so `limit: 1` — this is a count against zero and never a list. Named

 * name; they never share a scope, and two `local.utterances` in one module is a trap for whoever
 * moves one of them.
 *
 * `when` for the reason every scoped query here carries it: an unresolved anchor is *pruned* rather
 * than sent, and pruning widens, so without it a subject that has not arrived asks for every
 * TextBlock in the space.
 *
 * On the well rather than on the panel root, because its one reader is the Extract now button under
 * the chips. It spent a commit at the root, when that button was in the header and a `$queries`
 * entry is only readable from inside the node declaring it. Back down here it is also skipped on a

          No wrapper row around it, which is not tidiness. `extractNowControl` renders nothing
          outside a live call, and an empty `Row` is still a flex item — so the well went on paying a
          whole gap for a control that was not there. The button aligns itself instead.

/**
 * The transcript itself — the utterances, read from the record rather than from this session.
 *
 * It used to render a session-local buffer of the last twenty blocks *this* agent wrote, on the
 * reasoning that a panel for watching a transcript being made is a different thing from one for
 * reading it. People who used it disagreed on every count: they wanted everyone's utterances, and
 * they wanted them still there after the call restarted.
 *
 * All three complaints were one cause. The shared record already holds every agent's lines, each
 * carrying its author and the moment it was said, and it already outlives the session —
 * `spaceStore.exportCallTranscript` has been reading exactly this to write a text file with real
 * names in it. The panel was the only thing not looking at it.
 *
 * Drilled down from the collection rather than hydrated with `include`, because
 * `CollectionBlock.children` is an untyped to-many: the ids arrive but cannot render themselves.
 * The same query the calls list already uses for a finished meeting. See
 * `docs/architecture/transcripts.md`.
 *
 * ## The rows, without the box they scroll in
 *
 * This is the utterances alone. `transcriptFeed` below is these plus the unsaved line, inside a
 * scroll area that follows the tail — the arrangement almost everything wants, and the one the
 * panel places.
 *
 * They are separate because *where the unsaved line goes* is a decision only the placer can make.
 * It belongs immediately after the last saved row, inside the same scroll region — anywhere else
 * and it is separated from the words it is about to become by however much empty panel there
 * happens to be. But an interface showing a **past** call has to leave it out: the buffer is this
 * agent's live microphone, and appending it to last month's transcript would be showing one
 * meeting's words under another meeting's heading. Owning the scroll area is what lets such an
 * interface put the line in the right place *and* omit it on the wrong call, which is exactly what
 * the workshop template does.
 */
/**
 * What the feed shows when it holds nothing — one placeholder, six situations.
 *
 * There were two of these and they did not look alike. A call with no words in it got this
 * treatment: an icon and a centred line. No call at all got an italic sentence in `captureStatus`,
 * which renders *above* the feed rather than in it — so the same emptiness was a tidy placeholder
 * or a stray caption under the meter depending on whether an address happened to name a call. One
 * shape now, in the one place the reader is looking.
 *
 * ## Split on the same line the rest of the panel is split on
 *
 * "Nothing has been said here yet" is true in five of the six and useless on its own: what a person
 * does next is different in each, and the panel is the only thing that knows which. The six sort
 * cleanly into the two the whole panel already sorts by — a call being read back, and the live one —
 * so they are two branches of three rather than one chain of six.
 *
 * That split is structural rather than tidiness. A `$if` **remounts** when its condition flips, so
 * continuing a call fades the old sentence out and the new one in, the way switching between calls
 * already does. Kept as one node the text swapped in place, mid-sentence, with no transition — the
 * one moment in this panel that still read as a jump. Nothing about the branches themselves changed.
 *
 * Reading a call back:
 *
 * - **Nothing can pick it up.** Another call is already running, or there is no call module. Say
 *   only what is true: a clause telling somebody to continue a meeting, with nothing on screen or in
 *   the rail willing to do it, is worse than no clause.
 * - **Somebody is in it.** Then the act is joining them, not restarting it, and the button beside
 *   this says the same word.
 * - **Nobody is in it.** The offer is to pick it up.
 *
 * The live view:
 *
 * - **No call at all.** Nothing to record and nothing to read: the whole sentence is the way in.
 *   Joining is the only step it names, because it is usually the only one — `recordCalls` defaults
 *   on, so transcription starts with the call and nobody presses anything.
 * - **In a call, with a microphone, not recording.** The one state where a button on this panel
 *   changes the answer. `available` is what keeps it out of the second between joining a call and
 *   the microphone coming up: recording is about to start on its own there, so telling somebody to
 *   press Transcribe is both wrong and unreadable — it was on screen just long enough to change the
 *   sentence twice. The same test coverage uses, for the same reason.
 * - **In a call, recording.** Nothing to add — the panel is waiting for somebody to speak, and
 *   saying so twice would be furniture.
 *
 * ## Neither sentence mentions the subject
 *
 * Whole-token substitution rewrites `{ $: 'modules.transcribe.collectionId' }` where a `$part`
 * points this at another call, and leaves an expression that merely *mentions* it alone — so a
 * sentence built around the subject would go on describing the live call inside a panel about a past
 * one. `VIEWING_LIVE_EXPR` reads the address for that reason, and `callId` is a fact about this
 * agent's own session either way.

      or two after the condition, so the sentence was still painted for the collapse.

      What fixes it is above: the section fades and keeps its box for longer than this takes. So the

                            the same conversation, so on a call recorded last Tuesday all two hundred
                            of them read "6 days ago" — the same string on every line, carrying no
                            information and taking the width that made the row wrap. What a reader
                            wants from a line of a finished meeting is where in it the line was, and
                            that is the clock.

                            On the live call relative earns its place: the tail is minutes old, the
                            numbers differ row to row, and they move on their own.

                            `narrow` for the live side because a transcript stamp is a *coordinate* —
                            something skimmed past to find a moment, not read — and a coordinate wants
                            to be terse at any width. That is a fact about the row rather than about
                            the panel, so it is not conditional on how much room there is.

                            One node rather than an `$if` on the two: `relative` short-circuits inside
                            the primitive, so `timeStyle` simply goes unread while it is true. A
                            branch here would unmount and rebuild the row every time a call ended.

                            ## Last on the row, after the marks

                            It used to sit before them, and in `en-US` that put "Aa" hard against
                            "PM" — two letterforms beside two letterforms in the same faint grey,
                            reading as one word. Moving the marks up to the name fixes it by
                            separation rather than by decoration, which is what makes it hold: an
                            `en-GB` reader sees "14:32" and never had the collision, so an
                            icon-level or colour-level fix would have been treating one locale's
                            symptom. The mark is about the line and the time is about the moment;
                            they were only ever neighbours by accident.

                          What this line is, where it is not simply what somebody said.

                          Only ever shown for the two that are not plain speech, and `spoken` stays
                          silent. That is the whole economy of the thing: a transcript is speech
                          almost all the way down, so marking it would put furniture on every row to
                          restate the panel's own title, and a mark that appears everywhere is one
                          people stop reading. The reader's default assumption is already right; the
                          mark exists for where it would not be.

                          Which is also why neither of these is a sparkle. Machine-heard is the
                          assumption here, so "this came from a model" is not news — that icon earns
                          its place on an extraction card, where a record stands for something
                          inferred and the reader would otherwise have no way to tell.

                            `text-aa` rather than `keyboard`, which was the first guess and the
                            wrong one: a keyboard is a grid of small keys, and at 12px they merge
                            into a grey smudge that reads as "some icon". Two letterforms survive
                            the size and say "text" on sight.

                            And not a pencil, which is the edit button two elements along this same
                            row — one glyph cannot mean both "written rather than spoken" and
                            "change these words". `translate` means language and `key-return` means
                            submit; both are the wrong claim rather than an unclear one.

                                    In `en-US` the time ends "AM" or "PM", and two letterforms in
                                    the same faint grey immediately after two more letterforms are
                                    one word to the eye. Moving the mark to the other side of the row
                                    was tried first and did not help: what separates them is a
                                    *ground*, not a gap, so the mark stops being loose text on the
                                    row and becomes a thing sitting on it.

                                    `control-surface` is a step away from both `surface` and
                                    `surface-sunken` in either polarity, which is the whole reason

                                    BADGE_APPEARANCE_DEFAULTS, where this same transcript row is the
                                    case that argued it. The row carried a sunken fill when that was
                                    written and carries none now, and the choice survives the change
                                    precisely because it was made against both grounds.

                                    It was `text-aa`, which is the glyph the record button in this
                                    panel's own header now uses for transcription, as the call bar
                                    always did. One surface cannot spend the same letterform on "this
                                    module makes text" at the top and "somebody typed this" a few
                                    rows down, so the more literal mark takes this one. It also stays
                                    clear of "(edited)", which is the other provenance signal on
                                    these rows.

                            mended line reading as something somebody said is a claim nobody checked.
                            A tooltip is invisible on a touchscreen and to anyone not poking at rows,
                            which is exactly the wrong property for a trust signal.

                            "(edited)" rather than a badge or an asterisk: it is lighter than the
                            badge it replaces, needs no legend, and is the convention every reader
                            already holds from chat. An asterisk needs learning, and a star reads as
                            a rating.

                            The tooltip is then the upgrade rather than the message — it says *when*,
                            which is worth having and worth nothing if it is the only channel.

                                Two rows was half a box of empty space under a line that is usually
                                one line long. `autoGrow` starts it at the height of the text it is
                                standing in for and takes the room only when there is something to
                                put in it, which is the same behaviour the composer at the foot of
                                the panel has.

                                `fontSize` is pinned because `size: 'sm'` carries one: the size
                                presets set padding *and* type, so a compact control also shrank the
                                words — mending a line made it visibly smaller than the line beside
                                it, and switching to `md` would have fixed the type by making the box
                                bigger. The two are separable, so they are separated here.

          Two gates rather than one, because "is there a transcript record" and "has it answered"
          become true at different moments and only the second is worth waiting for.

          **A record on screen** is gated on the query having *answered*, not merely on the count: a
          list backed by a query is empty on its first frame, so an unqualified else asserts
          "nothing here" about a transcript that is still arriving — which on a long one is the
          wrong sentence for as long as it takes to fetch.

          **No record** is synchronous and needs no such wait, and this is where the missing state
          was: `when` refuses the query without a subject, and a query never asked never reports
          itself loaded, so gating on `utterancesLoaded` alone left the panel blank in the two
          situations a newcomer is most likely to be in — no call, and a call nobody has spoken in.

          The outer condition is the bare subject token and has to stay bare. Substitution is
          whole-token, so it is rewritten wherever a `$part` points this at another call, where an
          expression merely *mentioning* it would be left alone — which is exactly how the inner
          gate came to read the live collection inside a panel about a past one.

          "yet" is right even on a call that finished. A past transcript is not closed: the composer
          writes into whichever one is on screen, so a meeting nobody spoke in is still somewhere a
          note can be left.

 * Why nothing is happening, when nothing is.
 *
 * Every reason this module can produce no text, in one place: still starting, nothing to listen to,
 * a backend with no speech-to-text, no model installed — and the error alert when it failed outright.
 * From the reader's side an empty panel means all of those equally well, and only some of them are
 * worth acting on, so each one says which it is and the fixable one carries the button that fixes it.
 *
 * ## Why this is named
 *
 * It is the difference between "this isn't working" and "this can't work here, and here is why".
 * An interface arranging the module's pieces itself gets the transcript, the meter and the unsaved
 * line — all of which look normal-and-idle on a node with no transcription model at all — so
 * without this the one state that needs a person to do something is the one state with nothing on
 * screen. Placing it is a choice; not having it available was not.
 *
 * One part rather than five, because they are one sentence answered five ways and no interface has
 * a reason to take the missing-model case and refuse the no-audio one. The `Column` is the panel's
 * own gap made explicit, so this reads identically whether placed here or somewhere else.
 *
 * No `subject`: these are facts about this agent's session and this node, not about a call record.

 * that would be a second document to read alongside the first; the whole value is that it lands at
 * the moment it was written, among what was being said then. So it is a `TextBlock` in the same
 * collection, and `source` is what stops it passing as speech — see the field's own note.
 *
 * ## Why it is the panel's chrome and not part of the feed
 *
 * It used to sit *inside* the scroll region, after the unsaved line, so that it appeared where the
 * next thing to arrive would and moved down with it. That reads well on a full transcript and badly
 * on every other one: with two lines said, the box sits under the second of them halfway up an
 * otherwise empty panel, and it moves every time anybody speaks. A place to write is a fixture of
 * the surface rather than the last row of the document — so it is pinned below the feed, always at
 * the foot of the panel, and the words scroll behind it.
 *
 * Named as a part, for `captureMeter`'s reason: an interface arranging the module's pieces itself
 * would otherwise have the transcript and no way to write into it.

 * with two lines in it the saved words are at one end of a mostly-empty box and the unsaved line is

 * flow with the rows, it sits immediately after the last one whether there are two of them or two
 * hundred, and `pin: 'end'` follows it down. The words never move.
 *
 * ## Composed from the part rather than repeating it
 *
 * `$part` inside a part, which the resolver expands recursively — and the subject substitution
 * reaches the inner marker, because it is a whole-token rewrite over this node before the nesting
 * is resolved. So pointing this feed at another call points its rows at that call too, and there is
 * one query in the codebase rather than two that have to agree.

                  saying nothing about why, next to a placeholder already explaining that a call is
                  what is missing.

                  ## And it waits for the microphone, having tried not to

                  This asked `callId` for a day, so that it appeared the instant a call was joined
                  rather than a second later with the level meter. The cost was a label that turned
                  over in front of you: recording only starts once there is a stream to record, so
                  the button read "Transcribe" and then became "Transcribing" on its own.

                  There is no third option. The state genuinely changes in that second, so a label
                  that reports the state must change with it, and one that reports it early is
                  guessing — auto-join can still be refused by `recordCalls`, and a device that never
                  opens would leave the word "Transcribing" standing over nothing recorded, with no
                  diagnostic on screen, which is a far worse failure than waiting.

                  So it arrives with the meter and the coverage readout, already saying the settled
                  thing. That is one arrival for the whole panel rather than a control that appears
                  early to change its mind.

                  `enabled ||` stays, so the way *out* of recording never vanishes: a stream that
                  drops mid-call would otherwise take the stop button with it and leave this agent
                  recording with nothing on screen to say so.

          between them — is it hearing me, is it hearing everyone else, and why is nothing happening
          — and that question is not asked at all of a meeting somebody is reading back.

          ## And only while one of them has an answer

          A `Column` with nothing in it is still a flex item, so an empty one costs its parent a
          whole `gap` — twelve pixels of nothing between the header and the transcript. All three
          children are dark for the second between joining a call and the microphone coming up, so
          continuing a call pushed everything below this down by a gap, and then down again as the
          meter arrived. The box was invisible and the movement was not.

          The second term is the question the three of them share: is this agent recording, or is
          there a microphone to record. Every note below is reachable under one of those — a backend
          that cannot transcribe and a missing model are both learned by *trying*, which needs audio,
          and "nothing to listen to" is a stream vanishing from under a recording that is still on.

          ## Why it is not `status`

          It was `available || status != 'idle'`, which reads better and leaves the panel jumping
          around after a call ends. `status` is set at the *tail* of `stop`, after a flush that
          writes buffered text to the backend — so it lands a network round trip late, while
          `enabled` and `available` are signals that answer in the same frame the call is torn down
          in.

          That split the teardown across two repaints: the audio went, coverage left, recording
          stopped, the meter left — and this box stayed up holding an empty gap until the flush
          resolved, then collapsed under a placeholder that had already settled. Both terms here are
          synchronous, so the whole section leaves in one frame with everything else.

          Fading it out instead would have hidden the symptom by holding the gap on purpose for the
          length of the fade. Nothing needs to animate once it all leaves together.
