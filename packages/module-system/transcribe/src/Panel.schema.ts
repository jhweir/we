 * The microphone level, with the line speech has to cross drawn on it.
 *
 * The threshold marker is the point. A bare level bar answers "is audio arriving", which was never
 * really in doubt; what a user actually needs when nothing is being transcribed is "am I loud
 * enough", and that is only answerable against the number the VAD compares to. Both come from the
 * same measurement in the worklet, so the bar and the decision cannot disagree.
 *
 * Both widths arrive from the store as CSS percentages — the scale factor is a property of how loud
 * speech is, and belongs next to the numbers rather than in a template.
 *
 * ## Why this is named
 *
 * Named as a part because a template that supplies its own transcript panel otherwise loses the
 * answer to "is it hearing me". That is the one question a transcript cannot answer for itself: an
 * utterance takes seconds to buffer, transcribe and write, so a panel showing only saved lines is
 * indistinguishable from a broken microphone for the whole of that delay.
 *
 * The workshop template used to be that consumer, and its copy of the panel never placed this — so
 * the interface built around recording a meeting said *less* about a failing microphone than the
 * default one did. It places the whole panel now, which is the better answer to a shared piece; the
 * part stays for the interface that genuinely wants a different arrangement.
 *
 * No `subject`. Unlike the feed, this is about the microphone *this agent* is running right now,
 * which is a property of the session and not of any call record — pointing it at another call
 * would be pointing a live meter at something that is not being measured.

 * How much of this call is actually being written down.
 *
 * The one number a transcript most needs to admit, and until now it was computed and shown nowhere.
 * Transcription is per microphone: every agent records their own and appends to one shared record,
 * so a call where two of five people are transcribing produces a transcript **of two people** that
 * reads exactly like a transcript of the call. Nothing downstream can tell the difference — the
 * extraction pass proposes tasks and events from one side of a conversation as readily as from all
 * of it — and neither can whoever opens the record next week.
 *
 * Here rather than only on the finished record because here it is still actionable. The calls list
 * pairs the faces with an utterance count for the same reason, but it says so afterwards, when the
 * only remaining response is to distrust what you are reading. This says it while the meeting is
 * happening and somebody can still press record.
 *
 * Modelled on the meter above it — a label, and the state on the right — so the panel reads as one
 * set of readouts rather than a meter and then a warning. It states the count either way and only
 * changes *colour* when there is a gap: a number that appears when something is wrong is a number
 * nobody learns to read, and "4 of 4" is worth seeing precisely because it means the record is whole.
 *
 * Absent outside a call, where `callAgents` is empty. There is no coverage question about a
 * transcript with no other participants, and "1 of 1" would be noise on every solo recording.
 *
 * Named as a part so an interface that arranges this module's pieces itself can place it. Whether
 * to show it is a design decision an interface is entitled to make; being unable to make it is not.
 * No `subject`: coverage is about the call being recorded right now, which is the only call anyone
 * can still act on.

 * will be looked for and let a call narrow it, so the sentence becomes a lead-in rather than
 * something to rewrite every time a community adopts a model.
 *
 * ## One list, not two
 *
 * `extractionTargets` is already the union: every model this space may extract, each flagged with
 * whether this call is looking for it. So "what is on" and "what could be added" are one row of
 * chips rather than a list of pills and a search behind a button — which would be two surfaces that
 * have to agree, over a set that is a handful of entries.
 *
 * ## The state is said in colour, not in opacity
 *
 * An off chip is muted; it is not faded. Reduced opacity is what a *disabled* control looks like,
 * and these are the opposite of disabled — an unselected chip is the one thing on the row you are
 * most likely to want to press. The same confusion had the card's own action buttons fading with
 * the card they sat on.
 *
 * ## What a press actually changes
 *
 * A **group** decision recorded beside the call, not a private preference: the standing watch is one
 * registration the whole neighbourhood shares, so per-agent lists would have peers overwriting each
 * other's in a loop. It does not touch the space's own default, which is a community setting with
 * its own screen. And it applies to what is said from *here on*, because a watch keeps a
 * processed-turn cursor — which is why the note under the Extract button says pressing it is how the
 * rest of the conversation gets swept.
 *
 * ## Why this is named
 *
 * An interface that supplies its own extraction panel otherwise has no way to say what is being
 * extracted or to change it — the workshop template had exactly that gap. Registered so placing it
 * is naming it. No `subject`: what a call extracts is a fact about the call being recorded.

/**
 * The transcript itself — the utterances, read from the record rather than from this session.
 *
 * It used to render a session-local buffer of the last twenty blocks *this* agent wrote, on the
 * reasoning that a panel for watching a transcript being made is a different thing from one for
 * reading it. People who used it disagreed on every count: they wanted everyone's utterances, and
 * they wanted them still there after the call restarted.
 *
 * All three complaints were one cause. The shared record already holds every agent's lines, each
 * carrying its author and the moment it was said, and it already outlives the session —
 * `spaceStore.exportCallTranscript` has been reading exactly this to write a text file with real
 * names in it. The panel was the only thing not looking at it.
 *
 * Drilled down from the collection rather than hydrated with `include`, because
 * `CollectionBlock.children` is an untyped to-many: the ids arrive but cannot render themselves.
 * The same query the calls list already uses for a finished meeting. See
 * `docs/architecture/transcripts.md`.
 *
 * ## The rows, without the box they scroll in
 *
 * This is the utterances alone. `transcriptFeed` below is these plus the unsaved line, inside a
 * scroll area that follows the tail — the arrangement almost everything wants, and the one the
 * panel places.
 *
 * They are separate because *where the unsaved line goes* is a decision only the placer can make.
 * It belongs immediately after the last saved row, inside the same scroll region — anywhere else
 * and it is separated from the words it is about to become by however much empty panel there
 * happens to be. But an interface showing a **past** call has to leave it out: the buffer is this
 * agent's live microphone, and appending it to last month's transcript would be showing one
 * meeting's words under another meeting's heading. Owning the scroll area is what lets such an
 * interface put the line in the right place *and* omit it on the wrong call, which is exactly what
 * the workshop template does.

/**
 * Why nothing is happening, when nothing is.
 *
 * Every reason this module can produce no text, in one place: still starting, nothing to listen to,
 * a backend with no speech-to-text, no model installed — and the error alert when it failed outright.
 * From the reader's side an empty panel means all of those equally well, and only some of them are
 * worth acting on, so each one says which it is and the fixable one carries the button that fixes it.
 *
 * ## Why this is named
 *
 * It is the difference between "this isn't working" and "this can't work here, and here is why".
 * An interface arranging the module's pieces itself gets the transcript, the meter and the unsaved
 * line — all of which look normal-and-idle on a node with no transcription model at all — so
 * without this the one state that needs a person to do something is the one state with nothing on
 * screen. Placing it is a choice; not having it available was not.
 *
 * One part rather than five, because they are one sentence answered five ways and no interface has
 * a reason to take the missing-model case and refuse the no-audio one. The `Column` is the panel's
 * own gap made explicit, so this reads identically whether placed here or somewhere else.
 *
 * No `subject`: these are facts about this agent's session and this node, not about a call record.

 * with two lines in it the saved words are at one end of a mostly-empty box and the unsaved line is
