/**
 * The record toggle, contributed into the call's control bar.
 *
 * It sits beside mute and camera because that is what it is — a thing you turn on for this call,
 * while your attention is already on that bar. The module rail is where you *open the transcript*;
 * conflating the two put the only way to start recording on the far edge of the screen behind an
 * icon that gave no hint it had anything to do with the call in front of you.
 *
 * ## How it gets there
 *
 * Contributed to the `call-controls` anchor, which `@we/module-call` declares and marks with a
 * `$slot` in its bar. Neither module imports or names the other: the call module knows it has a bar
 * worth extending, this one knows it belongs in a call, and the host joins them. Uninstall the call
 * module and this contributes to an anchor nobody provides — reported at boot, rendering nothing.
 * The reverse works too: the bar simply has one fewer button.
 *
 * The anchor string is duplicated rather than imported for exactly that reason. Importing
 * `CALL_CONTROLS_ANCHOR` from `@we/module-call` would be a hard dependency on the module this is
 * meant to be independent of — the same coupling, moved from the schema into the import graph.

 * A flat `pill` here stayed fully rounded in a theme set to Sharp, which is the mismatch the bar
 * itself had. Restated rather than imported, for the same reason the anchor above is: a shared
 * constant would be a hard dependency on the module this is meant to work without. Both ends read
 * the same theme variable, which is what actually keeps them in step.
 *
 * The fallback is `we-button`'s own default, so on the Default preset this chip, the bar around it and
 * the buttons in both are all 8px — one radius, whatever the theme says, rather than three guesses at
 * how much a nested box should soften.

/**
 * What the notice says once somebody else is transcribing.
 *
 * It used to be an offer, and the offer is what changed. Joining a peer's transcript now happens on
 * its own — see the auto-join effect in `store.ts` for why that is a narrower decision than it
 * sounds — so this stopped being a question and became the declaration that goes with it. Nobody
 * should have to work out for themselves that their microphone started feeding a shared record.
 *
 * Which makes the wording load-bearing rather than cosmetic. "Ana is transcribing · you're in" says
 * three things in the order somebody needs them: that this call is being recorded, who started it,
 * and that they are part of it. The `Leave` beside it is the whole of the consent story now — the
 * same `toggle` the record button calls, which also marks this agent as having decided, so the
 * effect does not simply switch them back on.
 *
 * Named, because "somebody is transcribing" is a notification and "Ana is transcribing" is something
 * you can act on. The DID comes from the store and the name from `$agent`, which is how this module
 * puts a name to an agent without holding any profiles of its own.
 *
 * Both branches are gated on `invitedBy` as well as their own flag. It empties when no peer is
 * recording any longer, which is reachable in both: this agent can still be recording after the
 * person who started it stopped. Without the guard the row renders " is transcribing".

                    as a second, redder mute. Text is the thing this module produces.

                    The colour moved to the button. Red used to be carried here, on the glyph, which

                    is now the button's own fill, so the icon simply inherits its foreground and the
