/**
 * How a transcript finds the record it belongs to.

 * agreement is silent: nothing errors, the transcript is simply split in two, or attached to the
 * wrong meeting, or scattered loose into the space.
 *
 * The deps are the smallest thing that satisfies the contract — no transport, no presence driver,
