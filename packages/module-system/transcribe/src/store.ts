 * what makes muting the call stop the transcript: a muted track is disabled rather than removed, so
 * the worklet receives silence, the VAD never fires, and nothing is produced. A second
 * `getUserMedia` would have kept listening through the mute.
 *
 * ## What it writes
 *
 * A `CollectionBlock` with `kind: 'call'` per call, holding the utterances as `children`. The call
 * Not posts: a transcript is not authored content and should not arrive in a feed as though it were.
 *
 * The collection is what makes the transcript a *thing* rather than loose text — it groups one call's
 * utterances, carries its participants, and (later) its summary. It renders from its children and
 * never from an `editorState`, which is what keeps several agents writing into it conflict-free:
 * children links are add-only, whereas a shared serialized document would be last-write-wins.
 *
 * Author and timestamp come free from the model, so a block already knows who said it and when
 * without this module recording either — which is also why speaker attribution is free here and
 * needs no diarization: every agent transcribes only their own microphone.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * Created **lazily on first flush**, never on button press. A record therefore exists if and only if
 * somebody actually said something: no empty records are possible, and no delete path is needed. The
 * end is derived from the last child's timestamp rather than written, so nobody has to remember to
 * close it and it cannot go wrong when the creator is the first to leave.
 *
 * ## Converging on one record
 *
 * Whoever writes first creates the collection and announces it on presence as a
 * `{@link TRANSCRIBE_ACTIVITY}` activity; everyone else in the same call adopts it off the roster.
 * If two people speak for the first time inside the same heartbeat, both may create before either
 * sees the other — that yields two records for one meeting, which is cosmetic (every agent's blocks
 * are attached to a valid record) and dedupable on read. The simple version ships first.

   * refuse a link that is already there, and deliberately so: the alternative is a read-modify-write
   * that drops whoever loses the race. So the only way the relation becomes a set is if there is
   * exactly one writer per member, and the one writer who can never be raced about an agent's
   * presence is that agent.
   *
   * It used to append *everyone it could see*, from every agent that was recording. That is N writes
   * per person rather than one, it repeats on every session that resets the guard, and it grew
   * without bound: a two-person call carried each of them several times over, and the avatar row
   * drew a wall of the same two faces. Deduplicating at the point of drawing hid it; it did not stop
   * `$count` — or anything else that reads the relation — from being wrong.
   *
   * ## Why coverage survives
   *
   * The point of the roster is *coverage*: a transcript that shows somebody was present but silent
   * is worth much more than one that quietly looks complete. Appending only yourself would lose that
   * if it were tied to speaking — so it is not. The effect below runs for any agent in the call once
   * a record exists, whether or not they are recording and whether or not they ever say anything,
   * because the record's id is published on presence for everyone to read.
   *
   * ## Why the guard is keyed on the record
   *
   * Not on the call, which is derived from the space and so is the same id forever, and not cleared
   * when a call ends — an agent who leaves and rejoins the same conversation would otherwise append
   * itself a second time. Keyed on the collection, the answer to "have I already said I was here"
   * stays right across every leave and rejoin within a session.

   *
   * It used to stop short of that on purpose — joining a transcript somebody else had started was
   * held to be a different question from starting one, and starting one was left to a space setting
   * that did not exist. In practice the two are the same question asked at different
   * moments, and splitting them made the ordinary case the unreliable one: whether a meeting was
   * recorded depended on whether whoever happened to arrive first remembered to press a button. A
   * transcript that exists for four meetings out of five is worse than either alternative, because
   * nothing distinguishes "we chose not to record that one" from "nobody pressed it".
   *
   * The argument for joining carries over unchanged, and it is not a privacy argument: a refusal
   * does not stop the conversation being recorded, it only removes this agent's own words from the
   * record of a conversation they are part of, which produces a wrong transcript rather than a
   * smaller one. What survives from the old shape is the way out — `optedOut` is checked first, and
   * pressing Leave or stopping recording by hand sets it for the rest of the call.
   *
   * Three guards, and each is a case where starting would be wrong rather than merely unhelpful:
   * - no dataset: there is nowhere for the words to go. Also the one that must be tested rather than
   *   left to the teardown effect below, which switches recording off whenever the space is gone:
   *   that effect and this one would take turns for as long as no dataset was bound.
   * - no audio: there is nothing to record, and `enabled` would sit true against silence.
   * - a backend that cannot transcribe: caught here because `available` is answerable synchronously.
   *   Having no *model* is not, so that one is caught in `start` — see `giveUpAutoJoin`.
   *
   * A fourth guard is the space's, and the agent's: `recordCalls`, declared on the module and
   * resolved by the host across every level that had an opinion — so a community that does not want
   * its calls recorded, or somebody who does not want their own recorded here, is answered without
   * this effect knowing that either exists. Defaulted true where a host has no settings layer at
   * all, which is the behaviour every deployment had before there was one.
   *
   * Deliberately not routed through `toggle`, which opens the panel: a person pressing record wants

     * overlay *is* the lock. Once it is gone the divergence gate treats the record as human-owned,
     * so a later pass over the same conversation will not quietly overwrite what was typed here.
     *
     * There is no window worth worrying about for a `create`, which is the common case: the engine
     * writes real values whenever no human owns them, so the record has been on the board with the
     * model's wording since the pass ran. The accept changes nothing visible and the edit lands
     * immediately after it.
     *
     * A failed update leaves the suggestion accepted rather than rolling back, and says so. That is
     * the honest state — the decision was recorded and only the wording did not land — and the
     * record is now an ordinary one the reviewer can edit anywhere it appears.
