/**
 * The extraction readout, contributed under the call bar.
 *
 * ## Why a bar and not a popup
 *
 * Because a pass runs for minutes. Almost all of that is one LLM call, and on a local model it can
 * be several minutes — so the surface reporting it has to be something you can ignore and glance
 * back at. A modal interrupts once and then sits there being in the way; a strip under the bar
 * appears, says what is happening, and retracts.
 *
 * It also has to belong to the call rather than to the transcript panel. The pass outlives the panel
 * that started it, and the person most likely to want the readout is whoever is looking at the call
 * — including the four people out of five who did *not* start it.
 *
 * ## What it shows to whom
 *
 * Everyone sees every row: who is extracting, what phase, how long. That is deliberate and it is
 * what the host's relay exists to make possible — a pass runs on whichever member's machine happened
 * to start it, so which member holds the detailed view is otherwise decided by who pressed first.
 *
 * What only the runner has is the model exchange, because only their machine produced it. So the
 * disclosure is offered to everyone and *disabled* with a reason for a pass that is not theirs,
 * rather than hidden. A control that silently is not there reads as a bug; one that says why reads
 * as an explanation.
 *
 * ## Collapse
 *
 * One pass renders as one row. Two or more collapse behind a count, and each opens from there —
 * which is the shape James asked for, and the right one: a bar that grew a row per concurrent pass
 * would push the whole call's chrome around while somebody was using it.

 * ## Why this is in the transcript panel and not the call bar
 *
 * It used to be the whole of the chrome contribution, and that was one surface answering two
 * questions of very different sizes. "Is something happening?" is a glance, is wanted by everybody
 * in the call, and must not move the chrome around while somebody is using it. "What exactly was
 * sent to the model?" is reading — a prompt pane and a response pane, hundreds of pixels of
 * monospace — and is wanted occasionally, by one person, who is by then not looking at the call at
 * all.
 *
 * Putting both in a floating strip under the call bar meant the second kept winning: opening one
 * row took the strip to 520px and pushed the call's own controls around, and a bar that grew a row
 * per concurrent pass would have kept doing it. So the reading moves to the panel that is already
 * about the transcript, where there is room and where opening something costs the call nothing, and
 * the glance stays in the chrome as one line.
 *
 * The original argument for the chrome — that a pass outlives the panel that started it, and that
 * the four people who did *not* start it are the ones most likely to want the readout — is now
 * answered by the module rail: the Extraction launcher declares `busyWhen`, so it spins while any
 * peer's pass runs, for everybody, without the panel open. The square this module used to add to
 * the call bar for the same purpose doubled as the switch for automatic extraction — a group
 * decision, beside a personal one that looked identical — and the bar only exists during a call,
 * which is the one time nobody needs to be told to open the panel.

          explanation was repeated per pass. It also happened to be the box that stopped the caret

          Shown only while the space's setting is the reason a peer's row will not open, and it
          names the way out: this is the one moment somebody wants that setting, and settings is not
          where anyone looks for a control they have never seen. Gated on the setting rather than on
          a row lacking detail — see `detailWithheld` in the store for what the other gate showed.
