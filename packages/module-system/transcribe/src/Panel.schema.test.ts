/**
 * The transcription panel's shape — the decisions in it that are easy to undo by accident.
 *
 * Most of these assertions lived in `@we/template-showcase`'s tests, because the workshop template
 * used to supply a transcript panel of its own and they were checking that copy. The copy is gone
 * and the behaviour it existed for — following the call the address names — is here now, so the
 * tests are too. That relocation is the point: there is one transcript panel, and one place that
 * says what it must do.
 *
 * Serialised and searched rather than walked, the same way the showcase templates are tested. A
 * schema is data; what matters is whether the token is in the tree, not the path it sits at.
