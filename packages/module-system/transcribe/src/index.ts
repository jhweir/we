/**
 * The Transcribe feature module — speech to text for whatever the host is capturing.
 *
 * The fourth module, and the first that consumes another module's output. Notes proved a module can
 * own durable entities; the globe proved one can carry a heavyweight framework component; the call
 * module proved one can reach the ephemeral port. This one proves two modules can cooperate **without
 * knowing about each other**.
 *
 * ## How it hears a call
 *
 * It does not import `@we/module-call`, and the call module does not import this. The call declares
 * `audioSource: 'localAudio'`; the host reads that, and lends whatever it finds to every module store
 * as `deps.audioInput`. Neither module has a reference to the other, so either can be uninstalled and
 * the remaining one still works — this module simply reports that there is nothing to listen to.
 *
 * That indirection is also what satisfies the requirement that muting the call stops the transcript.
 * The stream handed over is the call's *own* `MediaStream`, not a copy: mute disables the track, the
 * track produces silence, and the VAD never fires. A module that opened its own `getUserMedia` would
 * have gone on transcribing someone who believed they were muted.
 *
 * ## Fragments-only, again
 *
 * No `frameworks`, no `components`. The one piece of genuinely imperative machinery — an
 * `AudioWorklet` doing voice-activity detection on the audio thread — lives in the store, which is
 * plain TypeScript against `deps.signal`. Browser APIs are not framework coupling.
 *
 * ## Where the transcript goes
 *
 * Into a `CollectionBlock` with `kind: 'call'` — one per call, holding the utterances as children and
 * the roster as `participants`, and attached to whatever node the call was anchored to via
 * `WeNode.calls`. Blocks used to be written loose into the space with `tag: 'transcript'`, which
 * collided with the Lexical tag field and left transcripts showing up in the Cards route's Text list
 * next to authored prose.
 *
 * The record is created on the first thing said, not on the button press, so a call nobody speaks in
 * leaves no trace. See `store.ts` for the convergence rule when several agents record at once, and
 * `docs/architecture/transcripts.md` for the shape as a contract — four things read it now, and
 * nothing enforces it.
 *
 * ## Who decides that it runs
 *
 * Being in a call starts it. Not a press of a button, and not conditional on a peer having pressed
 * one — those were treated as two questions for a while, and the split made the ordinary case the
 * unreliable one: whether a meeting was recorded came down to whether whoever arrived first
 * remembered. A transcript that exists four times out of five is worse than either default, since
 * nothing separates "we chose not to" from "nobody pressed it".
 *
 * Declining is per microphone, which is why it is a button rather than a prompt. An agent who stops
 * recording is not preventing a record of the call, only removing their own words from one being
 * made anyway — which looks like a privacy decision, buys almost none, and used to be taken by
 * accident by everyone who ignored a prompt. What it produced was a five-person meeting recorded
 * from one microphone, which reads exactly like a transcript of the meeting. See the effect in
 * `store.ts` for the guards, and `Panel.schema.ts` for the coverage readout that says how much of
 * the call is actually in the record.
 *
 * A community that does not want its calls recorded says so through `settings`, and so does an agent
 * who does not want their own recorded — see the declaration below. Declared rather than read off
 * the space: nothing in this module can see a space's decisions, and giving it that view to answer
 * one question would put the policy in the module and the space's schema in a module's reach.
 *
 * ## What it is not yet
 *
 * No speaker threading, and no summary generation — deliberately, because the next step is an LLM
 * pass that builds a knowledge map from this text, and it would rather re-segment raw utterances than
 * unpick someone else's structure. It now has somewhere to hang that summary when it arrives.

  /**
   * Named fragments a template can place itself.
   *
   * `transcriptFeed` is the utterances and nothing else — no capture controls, no status notes. A
   * template that wants a transcript beside a graph, or inside a panel of its own, places this
   * rather than the whole panel, and gets the live record with speaker attribution for free.
   *
   * With its **subject** named, so a placer can point it at a call this module is not recording —
   * an archive, or a board somebody opened from a link. The feed is written against this module's
   * own state and stays valid on its own; the host substitutes the expression when somebody asks
   * for another. Without that a part is welded to the state its module happens to hold, which is
   * what made these uncomposable while the field sat here unread.
   *
   * ## The two that go with it
   *
   * The feed alone was not enough, and the reason is worth stating because it is not obvious from
   * looking at it: a transcript shows what has been *written*, and writing an utterance takes the
   * speaker stopping, the audio reaching the model and the block landing. For those seconds the
   * feed is identical to a feed that has stopped working. The module's own panel never had that
   * problem — the meter and the unsaved line sit above it — but a template placing only the feed
   * inherited a several-second silence after every sentence and no way to tell it from a dead
   * microphone.
   *
   * So `captureMeter` (is it hearing me) and `pendingUtterance` (here is what it heard, not saved
   * yet) are named too. Neither takes a `subject`: both are about the microphone this agent is
   * running right now, which belongs to the session rather than to any call record — a live meter
   * pointed at last month's meeting would be measuring nothing.
   *
   * ## And the two that say why there is nothing
   *
   * `captureStatus` and `coverage` are here for a different reason from the first three, and it is
   * not that an interface ought to show them. Whether to is a design decision, and an interface
   * that judges its readers better served by less is entitled to make it. What it may not be is
   * *unable* to: with these trapped inside the default panel, a template arranging the pieces
   * itself could not have offered "no transcription model is installed" or "2 of 5 transcribing"
   * even having decided it wanted to.
   *
   * That is the line this map draws. A module's presentation is a default rather than a monopoly,
   * so what belongs here is everything an interface could reasonably want to place — and the
   * default panel then becomes one arrangement of these rather than the only one.
   *
   * The panel's own chrome is the exception that proves it: the header and the record button are
   * *the panel's*, not pieces of what this module knows, so an interface supplying a body writes
   * its own. It should need to far less often than it did — the workshop wrote a body for one
   * reason, route-awareness, and that now lives in the panel here.
