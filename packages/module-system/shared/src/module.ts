/**
 * The feature-module contract — what a module contributes, and what a host must accept.
 *
 * A feature module is the rung above blocks: a bundle of **stateful capability** that installs into a
 * space and can be placed by a template. Templates and themes are data; elements, components and
 * widgets are stateless presentation; a feature module is the thing that holds state and talks to
 * ports. See notes/we/August-2026/feature-modules.md.
 *
 * Declared here, in the neutral package, for the same reason `dataSource.ts` is: a module must be able
 * to describe itself without importing a host, a framework, or a backend.
 *
 * ## Why framework code is optional, not assumed
 *
 * `components` is the only field that can carry framework-specific values, and it is optional. A
 * module that ships **schema fragments only** imports nothing framework-shaped — and in a fragment
 * `Column` is a registry key, not an import, so the fragment renders on any framework whose renderer
 * registers that key.
 *
 * That is not merely tidy. An externally-loaded module bundle that imports its own copy of a reactive
 * framework gets a *second runtime*, and reactivity silently stops crossing the boundary — no error,
 * just components that never update. A module with no framework imports cannot have that problem.
 * Fragments-first is what makes dynamic loading tractable later.

 * underneath. A dock **insets**: the host shrinks the content viewport by the dock's size, so
 * nothing is hidden and the two can be used at once.
 *
 * Which one a piece of chrome wants is not a property of the module, it is a property of the
 * moment. A call's control bar overlays, because you glance at it; a call's video stage docks,
 * because you watch it while reading the space. So a module contributes both, and moves its own
 * state between them.
 *
 * ### Why the geometry is the host's
 *
 * A docked module used to position itself with `position: fixed` and a hardcoded offset for the
 * module rail — which meant every module re-derived geometry it cannot see, and none of them could
 * inset the content because the content viewport is not theirs to resize. Here the module says how
 * it would like to open, and the host owns everything after that: where it lands, what it has to
 * clear, what the viewport becomes, and what happens when the window is too narrow to give anything
 * up.
 *
 * "After that" now includes moving and resizing it. Every panel gets a grip, eight snap targets and
 * a toggle for taking room, from the frame the host wraps it in — so a module that wants its panel
 * somewhere else does not implement dragging, and a user who moves one keeps it moved across every
 * module that has one. The call module's six-placement menu is what this replaced; it was the third
 * piece of geometry a module had written for itself, and the first that other modules would have had
 * to copy.

 * and its own hand-written row in the settings panel, because there was nowhere else to put them.

 * — the same move `recordStore.displays` makes for a record's own form, and for the same reason. A
 * setting nobody wrote a screen for still has one.
 *
 * That closed the accretion — a capability wanting a setting today declares one here — but it did
 * **not** retire the three columns, and two of them are staying. This resolves along one axis, who
 * is asking; `autoInterpret` and `extractionTargets` also resolve by *subject*, a per-call decision

 * registered ∩ installed ∩ enabled, less muted — and every layer can only subtract. A setting is a

 * Which of a module's store members are host-chrome's alone.

 * ## The hole this closes
 *
 * `modules` is the one entry in the template bag that is not filtered per member. It cannot be:
 * `templateSurface.ts` classifies members it can *see* in a store interface it knows, and a module's
 * store is a flat record of signals, derived closures and actions that the host has never heard of.
 * So the whole namespace is handed to every tier, and the reason that was acceptable is that modules
 * are bundled — chosen by the deployment's seed, shipped with the app, at the app's own trust level.
 *
 * The Pocket is where that stopped holding. Its actions write `PocketItem` and `PocketFolder` into
 * the **agent's private root dataset**, so `modules.pocket.gather` from a synced space template is a
 * stranger's template writing into a store that has nothing to do with the space it came from —
 * the `resolvePerspective` shape again, a filtered bag around an unfiltered namespace.
 *
 * A module knows which of its members are chrome's, and nothing else does, so it says. The list is
 * subtracted from the space-tier bag and left intact at the chrome tier; a member named here is
 * *absent* below, exactly as an ungranted store member is, so a template gets no error channel.
 *
 * ## What this is not
 *
 * Not the state-vs-action split. Every member a module publishes is still tagged reactive, so a
 * `{ $: 'modules.call.leave' }` still *calls* during paint. Fixing that needs a `state()` marker in
 * `ModuleStoreDeps` and a change in every module's `createStore`; it is a real follow-up and this is
