/**
 * Everything the Pocket draws, as data.
 *
 * No framework import anywhere in this package — `Column`, `we-button` and `we-drop-zone` are
 * registry *keys* resolved by whichever renderer is running, so the same fragments would render
 * under a React host. Tier 1 in the convention: framework code only for imperative cores, and a
 * list of things you kept has none.
 *
 * ## Where its data comes from
 *
 * The root dataset, read straight from the fragments with `dataset: 'datasetStore.rootDataset'` and
 * written with `record.create`'s `perspective` option. That surface already existed; what the module
 * contract was missing was permission for a *module's own* entities to be installed there, which is
 * what `entities: { scope: 'agent' }` adds. Only the parts a template genuinely cannot do — building
 * a reference, asking whether one is already held, going to one, and remembering which folder you
 * are in — are in the store.
 */

/** The dataset every fragment here reads and writes. Named once so a typo cannot scatter. */

/**
 * The folder being looked at, straight from the store.
 *
 * It used to be found here instead — `modules.pocket.folderId ? … : first(local.rootFolder).id`,
 * over a `$query` for the root — which is how the panel ended up with a folder id the *store* did
 * not have. `enter` could then never record where you had come from, so the way back out never
 * appeared and a folder was a one-way door. One value, in one place, is the fix; the store now
 * resolves the root when the panel opens and holds the whole path.
 *
 * Empty for the one round trip before that resolves, which is what the gate below is for.
 *
 * A note that outlives the bug: **WE's `||` answers with a boolean, never with an operand.** Every
 * fallback in this file was once written that way, and each resolved to `true` — reaching the
 * executor as an `anchorId` ("data did not match any variant of untagged enum Scope") and as a link
 * source ("Link source must not be empty"). `??` is no use either, since these default to `''`
 * rather than to null. The ternary is the operator that answers with an operand.
