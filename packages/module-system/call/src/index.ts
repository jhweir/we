/**
 * The Call feature module — mesh WebRTC audio, video and screen share.
 *
 * The third module, and the one that tests what the first two could not: that a module can reach the
 * **ephemeral port**. Notes proved a module can own durable entities; the globe proved a module can
 * carry a heavyweight framework component. Neither sent a byte to another agent.
 *
 * ## Still fragments-only
 *
 * The surprise of this build. A call seemed certain to need a framework component — live video means
 * assigning `srcObject` to a `<video>`, which is imperative and cannot be expressed as data.
 *
 * It does not, because that imperative step belongs one layer down: `we-video` gained a `stream`
 * property, and a Lit primitive is precisely where WE puts imperative DOM work so that every
 * framework gets it once. So the most demanding module in the codebase declares no `frameworks` and
 * imports no framework — which means it is the strongest evidence so far that the fragments-first
 * contract is real rather than aspirational.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * - **No TURN server.** Peers behind symmetric NAT will not connect. TURN is infrastructure someone
 *   has to run, so it is a deployment decision rather than a module one.
 * - **No SFU.** Mesh only, so roughly four to six participants — see `mesh.ts`.
 * - **No camera *and* screen at once.** Sharing replaces the camera track — see `media.ts`.

/**
 * How far the call's chrome sits off the bottom edge.
 *
 * The bottom, and the reason is a property of *panels* rather than a preference about calls: a panel
 * has a titlebar and no footer. Chrome along the top covers the grip, the position menu and the
 * button that un-maximises — the three controls a panel is recovered with — so a bar up there is a
 * bar that can strand a panel. Along the bottom it covers nothing that is pressed, which is what
 * lets a maximised panel take the whole window.
 *
 * The second reason is templates. A page with a sticky header locks it to the top of the *content*,
 * and a bar fixed over that collides with it on every scroll — structurally, not by a few pixels
 * that could be tuned away. Nothing a template can do fixes that: it would have to know a module's
 * bar exists, and its header would jump down the moment somebody started a call. It is also where
 * every other call application puts these controls.
 *
 * It was at the top, and got there by accident — `bottom: '400'` is not a CSS length, so the offset
 * was dropped and `position: fixed` fell back to the static position. The accident read well enough
 * to be adopted deliberately, which held until panels could be maximised and templates grew sticky
 * headers.
 *
 * The stage no longer derives an offset from this. It used to: a second constant here restated the
 * bar's height so the two would stack, which is a relationship nothing enforced. The stage is a
 * *dock* now, and where a dock lands is the host's business — see `docks` at the bottom of this file.

/**
 * A strip across one edge of the content, for chrome that is centred on it rather than pinned to a
 * corner. The bar, the join prompt and the problem alert all sit in one.
 *
 * ## Why a strip, and not a centred box
 *
 * The bars used to centre themselves — `left: 50% + --we-chrome-center-x`, `translateX(-50%)` —
 * which is right for as long as the content is wider than the bar and wrong the moment it is not:
 * a box centred on a space too narrow for it overhangs both sides equally, and the half that
 * crosses the sidebar leaves the window. That is what a panel taking enough of the right did to
 * the call controls, hang-up button first.
 *
 * A strip spanning the content's edges, with the bar as its one flex child under `justify-content:
 * safe center`, is the same centring while the bar fits and a clamp when it does not — `safe`
 * means "centre, unless that would overflow, in which case align to start". No measurement, no
 * second position to keep in step with the first, and the strip's edges are the same four numbers
 * the content is laid out from, so it slides with a dock exactly as the centred box did.
 *
 * Which end is the start is the host's call, published as `--we-chrome-give`: the side with the
 * deeper dock, so a bar that cannot fit covers the panel that squeezed it rather than the sidebar
 * or the window's edge. See the shell store for the reasoning.
 *
 * ## What the strip clears
 *
 * `--we-chrome-<edge>` is where the host says the content's edge is, so this clears a docked
 * panel along that edge as it clears a docked call stage. A panel that merely *floats* there is
 * deliberately not dodged: it takes no room, the user put it there by hand, and moving out of its
 * way would be chrome running from a decision somebody just made — worse than an overlap they can
 * see and undo. The asymmetry that makes that safe at the bottom would not hold at the top: a
 * panel's controls are all in its titlebar, so an overlap at the bottom covers content rather than
 * the way out.
 *
 * ## Why the strip is a `$surface`
 *
 * The strip's width is the content's width, which is exactly the number the bar needs in order to
 * decide how much of itself to show — see `COMPACT`. A surface is the one mechanism the system has
 * for a schema to read its own room, and it needs a box whose inline size is decided from outside,
 * which a strip pinned at both ends is and a shrink-to-fit bar is not.
 *
 * The strip passes pointer events through, since it spans the whole edge and would otherwise
 * swallow every click along the bottom of the content; the child has to switch them back on.

 * The bar's own corners, following the theme's **control** radius.
 *
 * It was a flat `pill`, so a theme set to Sharp drew a fully rounded bar around square-cornered
 * buttons — the one shape in the app that ignored the shape presets.
 *
 * `controlRadius` rather than `surfaceRadius`, and the distinction is what the two categories are
 * for. A surface is a sheet with content on it — a modal, a drawer, a docked panel — and its radius
 * is about the material. This is a cluster of buttons and nothing else, drawn tight around them, so
 * its corners are a statement about controls; under the Pill preset (controls pill, surfaces 600) a
 * surface-radius bar would be a 16px box around pill buttons, the same mismatch mirrored. The
 * editor's history and mode clusters already read this var for the same reason, while its save and
 * close panel reads the surface one.
 *
 * The fallback is what **Default** looks like, since that preset sets no variable at all — so it has
 * to be a real answer rather than the hardcoded `pill` this started as, which left three of the four
 * presets working and the fourth indistinguishable from Pill. `400` is that answer because it is
 * `we-button`'s own default: on Default the bar and the buttons inside it are both 8px, which is the
 * same relationship every other preset gives them.
 *
 * Not the concentric `inner + padding`, which would be `600` here and reads better in isolation. That
 * figure is only right while the padding is, and the radius is a theme variable: a theme set to Sharp
 * would then draw a bar with 8px corners around perfectly square buttons — this bug again, smaller.
 * It also collided with Rounded, which sets controls to `600` outright. Matching the controls exactly
 * is the one rule that survives all four presets, and it is what the editor's own history and mode
 * clusters do.

/**
 * A toggle button whose icon and tone follow the state it toggles.

 * These are the controls you reach for mid-sentence while looking at somebody else, so they are
 * worth the extra eight pixels; the bar is still a pill you can ignore. The icons follow on their
 * own, since a sized primitive publishes `--we-context-icon-size` for the icons slotted into it.
 *
 * `square` because there is nothing here but the icon. Without it the button keeps the horizontal
 * padding it holds for a label — 16px a side at `md` — so a 24px glyph sat in a 56px box, and three
 * toggles in a row read as three wide slabs rather than a set of buttons. Square sizes both axes
 * from the component height instead, which is also what the module rail's launchers do.
 *
 * The tooltip is required rather than optional, and names the **move** rather than the state — "Mute"
 * while unmuted, not "Unmuted". An icon-only control has no other way to say what it does, and a
 * microphone with a line through it is genuinely ambiguous about whether it reports a state or offers
 * one. The show/hide toggle beside these already phrased its tooltip that way; this makes the whole

 * Who is here — a readout, not a control.

 * somebody joined, which looks like the control changing state.
 *

 * when you are *not* in the call is faces and "3 in a call"; this is faces and "3 in the call". One
 * sentence, two tenses.
 *
 * Faces come from `tileFaces` rather than from the roster, so a profile arriving fills them in
 * without touching `tiles` — which is what keeps a late avatar from remounting somebody's video.
 * Three, because past that the stack is a smudge at this size and the number is doing the work.
 *
 * ## The roster on hover
 *
 * Three faces and a number answer "how many"; only the list answers "who". It hangs off the whole
 * readout rather than off the avatars, because what a reader points at is the faces *and* the words
 * beside them — a tooltip owned by the stack alone produces nothing when you hover "5 in the call".
 *
 * It lists everyone, not the three that were drawn: the people the stack had to hide are exactly the
 * ones there is no other way to find out about.
 *
 * `peopleTooltip` is the kit's, not this module's. It was written out by hand here first — the kit
 * lived under `templates/` and `modules → templates` is the sideways edge the dependency rules
 * forbid — and that copy is what made the packaging wrong rather than the module unusual, so the
 * portable tier moved to `@we/schema-kit` and this reaches for it like a template would.

 * the control is *about* ("Screen share"), which is what a menu line should say, because a menu

 * Screen share keeps the same glyph in both states, unlike the mute and camera buttons beside it.
 * `monitor-arrow-up` is a *subject*, not a state: it is your screen, going out. Dropping the arrow
 * while sharing read as the screen leaving — backwards, at the one moment the button has something
 * to report. So the variant carries the state, exactly as it does for the show/hide toggle, and the

      controls in it and on whatever a theme does to a button, so it would be a number that is wrong
      the first time anything changes.

/**
 * The call's audio, attached to the document independently of anything you can see.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * Because sound and picture were one decision, and the picture is conditional in three separate
 * places. A tile renders `we-video` only while that peer `hasPicture`; the stage renders tiles only
 * while it is open; and the host unmounts a dock whose edge is null — deliberately, so a stage
 * nobody is watching stops decoding video. Each of those is right on its own terms, and each one
 * silenced the call, because a `<video>` element was the only thing a remote stream was ever
 * attached to. Turn your camera off and nobody could hear you. Put the video away and the call went
 * quiet — which is a valid thing to want and was the fastest way to break it.
 *
 * A call is audio first. So the audio hangs off `active` and nothing else: it is mounted from the
 * moment you are in a call until you leave, at the same anchor as the control bar, whatever the
 * stage is doing. One `we-audio` per remote participant, playing that peer's stream.
 *
 * ## Why not one element for everyone
 *
 * A `MediaStream` per peer is what the mesh produces — `ontrack` adds each arriving track to that
 * peer's own stream — and mixing them into one would mean a `WebAudio` graph this module has no
 * other use for. Per-peer also means a peer leaving takes their element with them, which is exactly
 * what `$each` over the tiles already expresses.
 *
 * Remote tiles only: your own tile is your own microphone, and playing that back is a feedback loop.
 *
 * Nothing is visible. `we-audio` without `controls` draws nothing, and an audio element plays
 * whether or not anything is painted for it — visibility and playback are unrelated for media
 * elements, which is the whole property being relied on here.

/**
 * The way back into a call somebody is reading.
 *
 * ## Why the call module owns it rather than a panel
 *
 * It lived in the transcript panel's header, and being there was a category error that showed up as
 * an asymmetry: two panels sit side by side about the same call, and only one of them offered the
 * way into it. A panel's header control is for the thing that panel *is* about — Transcribe belongs
 * beside "Transcript" — and picking a call back up is about the call.
 *
 * So it is published here, as a part, and whatever draws a call's name places it. That also means it
 * survives both panels being closed, which the panel copy could not: closing the transcript took the
 * only visible way back with it and left the module rail, which nobody finds.
 *
 * ## It stays put, and changes colour
 *
 * It used to be absent whenever a call was running, which made it the only thing on a pill that
 * came and went — and it went at the moment the pill had the most to say, since a live call is
 * usually shown with no `?call=` in the address at all.
 *
 * So the control is always there while there is a call to be about, and the four things it can mean
 * are carried by its colour, its label and whether it can be pressed. Red for the call you are in,
 * which is the calls list's own marker for its live row, tested the same way so the two cannot
 * disagree. Refused with a reason while a *different* call runs, rather than vanishing: continuing
 * this one would tear that one down and re-point every peer's transcript at this record, which is
 * the call store's rule and not a preference. `goToCall` refuses in the same words.
 *
 * ## No subject
 *
 * Deliberately, where `transcriptFeed` has one. Substitution is whole-token, and every expression
 * here mentions the record inside a longer sentence — the liveness tests, the colour, the guard — so
 * a `subject` would rewrite the action and leave all of them talking about the screen. Half a
 * rewritten sentence is worse than none, and this button has one honest meaning anyway: the call in
 * front of you.

    A call in progress keeps its chrome wherever you go.

    is *about* that space and wrong for this: a call outlives navigating away from where it started,
    so in a space that has not enabled calls the bar vanished while the call carried on — hang-up
    button included. Nothing was broken underneath, which is what made it read as a crash.

    `active` is false the moment the call ends, which is the condition this has to satisfy: a key
    that stayed true would make the bar permanent.

   * what makes the same declaration inset on a monitor and float on a laptop.
