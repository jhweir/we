/**
 * Where the call's sound comes from — an invariant no type can hold and nothing else asserts.
 *
 * A call's audio used to come out of the participant tiles' `<video>` elements, which are the most
 * conditional thing in the module: a tile renders one only while that peer has a picture, the stage
 * renders tiles only while it is open, and the host unmounts a dock nobody has open. So the sound
 * disappeared for three unrelated reasons, each of which looks correct in the file it lives in.
 *
 * These tests pin the arrangement that fixed it: the audio hangs off `active` and the pictures stay
 * silent. Structural rather than behavioural, because the failure is structural — every piece
 * rendered exactly as written, in the wrong dependency.
