/**
 * The call store — what a template can read and drive.
 *
 * Written against `ModuleStoreDeps` alone: `signal` and `effect` for reactivity, `ephemeral` for
 * transport, `presence` for membership, `dataset`/`selfId` for scope. It imports no framework and no
 * backend, which is what lets the whole module ship as schema fragments.
 *
 * ## The shape of the thing
 *
 * Three collaborators, each ignorant of the others' failure modes:
 *
 * - **presence** owns *who is in the call* (an activity, expiring on TTL)
 * - **the mesh** owns *connections to them* (reconciled against that roster)
 * - **the media controller** owns *this agent's devices*
 *
 * This file is the only place they meet, and the meeting is deliberately one-directional: presence
 * drives the mesh, and media drives what the mesh sends. Nothing flows back — the mesh never tells
 * presence who is in the call, because a connection failing is not the same as a peer leaving.

   * Nothing deletes an empty one. A call that produced no transcript still happened, and the only

   * partition is nobody. That is the same trap as `mode: 'feed'`: a peer who cannot see the other

   * empties away instead, which is a display decision and reversible.

    source open for any space holding a live activity, so the roster survives too.

    That leaves only the first half, and it is the wrong way round. Being dropped out of a call
    because you went to look something up is the surprise; a call you have to stay still for is not
    one you can use. So the call ends when somebody ends it, and nothing else — hanging up, joining
    another (see `join`), or losing the module.

    Nothing replaces this effect. There is deliberately no "the dataset went away" case: a null

     * was running, and it could not grow when another module contributed into this bar's column.

     * who is not in the call yet — that is the same object in the same place, so it takes the same

     * The rail's call button, in every state it can be pressed in. One promise: *go to the call.*
     *
     * The launcher used to be a bare join outright, which made it three different things
     * depending on what you were already doing, two of them wrong:
     *
     * - In this space's call, `join` returns early on the matching id — so the button was silently
     *   dead. Nothing in permanent chrome should absorb a click and do nothing.
     * - In an anchored call, or a call in another space, the ids differ — so it **tore that call
     *   down** and started a new one, with no confirmation. A rail button is pressed by accident;
     *   ending a live conversation is not something it should be able to do.
     *
     * So this never calls `join` while a call is running. What is left is the reading that holds in
     * all three states — bring me to the call — and it costs nothing when there is no call, because
     * starting one is how you get to it.
     *
     * Switching between calls is still expressible; it just is not this button. `joinCall` and
     * `joinAnchoredCall` keep their replace-the-current-call semantics for the template controls that
     * mean it — a card's Continue, a post's call button — where the target is named and the intent
     * is explicit.
     *
     * ## It shows, and never hides
     *
     * This toggled the stage once, on the reasoning that a rail button is a tab and a tab's second
     * press closes what the first opened. It made a liar of every control that calls it: the button
     * says *go to the call* and hiding the video is the opposite of going to it, so pressing the lit
     * rail tab — or a card's button — put the call away. Reported within a day of shipping, from a
     * calls list, which is exactly where it reads worst.
     *
     * "Go to" is a direction, so this is idempotent the way every other navigation is: pressing Home
     * while on Home does nothing and surprises nobody. Putting the video away is a real thing to
     * want and has two controls of its own — the panel's close button, and Video in the call bar —
     * neither of which is named after going somewhere.
