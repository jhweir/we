/**
 * The Notes feature module — a per-space scratchpad in a right-hand dock panel.
 *
 * The second module, and originally chosen to prove **module-owned entities** worked. It did, and
 * then the point stopped being worth making here: it owned a `Note` whose entire content was a
 * string, which is a `TextBlock` with fewer fields. Two nouns for one thing meant a note written in
 * the composer and a note written in this panel were unrelated records that could never meet.
 *
 * ## Own the container, never the content
 *
 * A note is now a core `TextBlock`, held in a `CollectionBlock` with `kind: 'notes'` — one per space,
 * created on the first note written there. That is the rule the module system settled on: borrow the
 * shared vocabulary for *what a thing is*, and own only the container that says *what surface it
 * belongs to*.
 *
 * It buys more than deduplication. A module that names entities by string rather than shipping
 * decorated classes needs no `backends` declaration, so writing durable data no longer costs
 * portability — which is why this module still declares none while writing to the space.
 *
 * The container is a `CollectionBlock` rather than a `kind`-less bag of tagged blocks because
 * containment and taxonomy are different questions. A tag is what a *user* says a thing is about, and
 * is theirs to remove; if the panel's contents were "blocks tagged note", removing a tag would
 * silently empty someone's scratchpad, and anything anyone tagged would appear in it.
 *
 * Old `Note` records are still read (see `Note.ts`) and never written. Dropping their manifest would
 * not delete them, it would orphan them.
 *
 * ## Fragments, not components
 *
 * Every piece of UI here is a `SchemaNode`. Nothing in this package imports Solid, `@we/components`,
 * or any framework — `Column`, `we-button` and `we-textarea` are registry *keys* resolved by whichever
 * renderer is running, so the same fragments would render under a React host. The module is Tier 1 in
 * the convention: framework code only for imperative cores, and a notes panel has none.
 *
 * Note what that buys concretely: this module has no framework import to duplicate, so it cannot
 * introduce the second-runtime hazard when modules eventually load dynamically.
 *
 * ## Where its state lives
 *
 * - **The notes themselves** — a live `$query` in the fragment. No store method, no manual
 *   subscription; the renderer's reactivity does it.
 * - **Creating one** — `record.create`, already in the stores bag. The module ships no CRUD wrapper.
 * - **The collection** — found by `$query`, not held anywhere. Deriving it every time is what keeps
 *   it correct across a space switch; a cached id would write this space's notes into the last one.
 * - **Panel open/closed** — the store, because this is *chrome*. `$localState` is per-node and would
 *   reset the panel every time the route changed, which is exactly what a docked panel must not do.
 *
 * The store's reactivity is injected (`deps.signal`) rather than imported, the same port trick that
 * keeps `@we/schema-shared` framework-neutral.
