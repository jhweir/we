/**
 * What a template may name inside a `GraphView`.
 *
 * This file is the reason the plugin system is usable rather than merely well-designed. Props tell an
 * author that `layout.type` is a string; nothing in a prop list says which strings exist, and a plugin
 * nobody can name might as well not be registered. The globe is the cautionary case — its layer
 * protocol is good, and an LLM still cannot author a globe template, because no catalog of layer names
 * ever reaches the generated context.
 *
 * So the catalog is declared here and picked up by `@we/ai-context` (`context: { type: 'plugins' }` in
 * this package's `package.json`), landing in CLAUDE.md alongside the component registry. A module
 * contributing its own expander adds to its own catalog and is documented the same way — which is what
 * makes "describe the graph you want" keep working for plugins that did not exist when the engine was
 * written.
 *
 * Keep the examples runnable. An author — human or otherwise — composes from a worked snippet far
 * better than from an option table, and a stale example is worse than none.
