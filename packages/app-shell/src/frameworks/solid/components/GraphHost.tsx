  `@we/graph-solid` ships it as a separate entry rather than injecting it, which is right for a

  that *renders and is invisible*. Every element is in the DOM with the right classes and the right
  CSS custom properties on it, and none of them mean anything: no `position: absolute`, so nodes
  stack in flow instead of at their coordinates; no size or background on the dot, so marks vanish
  and only their labels survive; no stroke on the edges. It reads as a broken layout engine rather
  than a missing file. The graph-explorer playground had the import and the app never did.

 * is the point of the `nodeContent` seam: `BlockRenderer` drags in the block system and the design
 * system, and a graph engine that imported any of that would stop being portable.
 *
 * `editorState` is already on the node — it is a declared string property, so the row the seed
 * fetched carried it into `data` — and handed over exactly as it arrived. A file-backed property
 * resolves to a `data:…;base64,…` blob rather than to JSON, and `BlockRenderer` already knows to
 * decode a string; parsing it here first threw on every card and rendered nothing, which is why they
 * all looked empty.
 *
 * ## Why it draws the label when there is no document
 *
 * A style rule names `content` for every card it matches, and a board holds more than one kind of
 * record: the workshop board is `TaskBlock`s and `EventBlock`s beside composed cards, and only a
 * `CollectionBlock` has an `editorState` at all. The renderer's own fallback does not cover this —
 * it draws the label when the *component* is missing, which is not the same as a component that
 * renders nothing — so a freshly extracted task arrived as a card with nothing in it, and a board of
 * them read as an empty canvas. That is the worst possible rendering of "extraction worked".
 *
 * The same class the renderer's fallback uses, so a card that falls back here is indistinguishable
 * from one whose rule never asked for content.

     * that leaves its single row alone. A space with one task in it already: extract a second, and
     * the probe's answer is the same first row, so nothing fires and the board stays as loaded.

     * question and that question's answer really had changed — which is what made this look like a
     * board bug rather than a notification one.

     * So the engine hands over the read it made and this subscribes to exactly that. The rows are
     * still thrown away; what they are for is the fingerprint, and it now covers the same records
     * the seed drew. Cost is one subscription per distinct read — four for a board — each paging
     * exactly what the seed would have fetched anyway.
