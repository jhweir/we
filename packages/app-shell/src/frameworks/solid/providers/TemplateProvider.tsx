   * closure's own lookup — a filtered bag around an unfiltered walk.
   *
   * The fix is not a better walk. The option means *which dataset*, and the datasets are a closed
   * set of four accessors the host itself names; there is no template for which the answer is "some
   * arbitrary path". So this is the whole vocabulary, and anything else resolves to null — which
   * falls through to the current dataset, exactly as an omitted option does.
   *

    Shell chrome — host slots plus anything feature modules or the interface itself contribute.

    Outside the keyed Router, so it never remounts on template switches; that isolation is why a
    template has no channel into the shell.

    ## Why the children are a getter, and why the node has a type

    Contributions used to all arrive before the first render — modules register at boot — so reading
    `nodes()` once was enough. A template declaring panels breaks that: its frames register when a
    template says it has them, which is after this runs. So the list is re-read when the registry
    announces.

    The `type` is what makes the re-read reach anything. A *typeless* node renders its children
    through an unmemoized fragment, so the read is untracked and a getter would never re-run; a typed
    one goes through `createMemo(() => renderChildren(node.children))`. `display: contents` keeps the
    wrapper out of the layout entirely — the same trick `dockFrame` uses, for the same reason.

    The node's own identity never changes, so nothing here rebuilds. `renderChildren` maps with a
    reference-keyed `<For>`, so a newly declared panel mounts on its own and every other piece of
    chrome — a call's live video among them — stays exactly where it was.

        its chips from `extractionTargets` — and until now the only thing that expanded a part was a
        *template* placing one. So the workshop, which supplies both panel bodies and renders them
        through `TemplatePanelBody`, worked; the default template rendered the module's own panels
        through this path and drew "Unknown component $part" in a red box where each fragment should
        have been.
