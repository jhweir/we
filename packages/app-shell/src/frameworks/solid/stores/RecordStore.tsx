/**
 * RecordStore — creating one instance of a model, whatever the model turns out to be.
 *
 * The counterpart to {@link ShapeStore}, and deliberately not part of it. That store is about
 * *defining* a model: an occasional, deliberate, admin-shaped act performed by whoever is shaping a
 * community's vocabulary. This one is about *using* one, which is an everyday act performed by
 * everybody. They share a manifest and nothing else — different audiences, different lifetimes, and
 * a wizard whose draft is a list of field declarations has nothing in common with a form whose
 * draft is a list of values.
 *
 * ## Why the draft lives in a store rather than in `$localState`
 *
 * Because the fields come from data. `$localState` names are fixed when a template is written, so a
 * form over a model chosen at runtime has no names to declare, and no `$setLocal` can address a
 * field nobody knew about. That is the same wall the shape wizard hit, and it is why `shapeDraft`
 * sits in a store too — not a preference about where state goes.
 *
 * ## Why it does not create posts
 *
 * A post is composed, not filled in: it is a `CollectionBlock` holding a tree of blocks, authored
 * through `BlockComposer`, which produces a serialized document rather than a set of field values.
 * A surface that offers both should offer the composer for that case and this for the rest — one
 * entry point, two bodies. Folding a document editor into a generated form would serve neither.
