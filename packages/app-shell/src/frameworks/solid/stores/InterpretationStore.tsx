/**
 * InterpretationStore — what extraction is doing in this space, right now.
 *
 * Three things joined into one list: the backend's own report of passes running on this node, the
 * relay's report of passes running on everyone else's, and the profile cache that turns a DID into
 * a face and a name.
 *
 * ## Why it is a host store and not module state
 *
 * The module contract already argues this, for the watch rather than its readout: a standing watch
 * is a dataset-level registration that outlives the module instance that asked for it, so handing
 * it to a store whose lifetime is a panel being open invites one per mount. The same is true of the
 * feed. A pass started by the transcribe panel is still running after that panel closes, and it is
 * still worth showing — the call bar outlives the panel, and so should the row under it.
 *
 * Which also makes this the only layer that *can* hold it. The relay needs the ephemeral port and
 * the current dataset; the runner's name needs the profile cache; neither is a module's to reach.
 *
 * ## Presentation lives here
 *
 * `label` and `elapsed` are strings, computed in the store. A schema has no arithmetic and no date
 * formatting, so "0:42" and "Extracted 3 tasks" are unreachable from a template — the same reason
 * `runtimeStore.aiModels` carries `statusText` and `themeStore` builds its own view models.
