/**
 * DatasetStore — the agent's datasets: which exist, which is active, and what schema each holds.
 *
 * A dataset is the neutral term for a queryable data container — an AD4M perspective in this
 * backend (a repo/branch or database elsewhere). This store owns the dataset list and ordering,
 * the active dataset (with its registered models and we-space status), the system datasets
 * (root/test/global/marketplace), and the agent's root-dataset settings.
 *
 * Dataset lifecycle (list/create/remove/subscribe) runs through the session's
 * `DatasetLifecyclePort`. The coupling that remains is the model layer: schema install and
 * model reads operate on the handles (typed `DatasetProxy` via @we/entities) — that half
 * neutralizes when compiled models bridge onto the neutral query engine.
 *
 * Space-model concerns (the `Space` entities that *describe* shared datasets) live in SpaceStore,
 * which layers on top of this store and reacts to dataset changes via `onDatasetRemoved` and the
 * `currentDataset` signal.
