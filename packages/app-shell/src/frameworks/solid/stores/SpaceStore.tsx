    Row identity, held stable while a row's *content* is unchanged.

    `<For>` — which is what `$each` renders through — keys by reference, so handing it a fresh
    object for every row on every recompute destroys and rebuilds the whole subtree. That is not a
    render-cost point: everything below it loses its `$localState`, so toggling any one setting in
    the space-settings panel reset the open tab and threw away a half-typed name and description.
    The query path solved this long ago with `reconcile({ key: 'id' })`; a store-backed list has no
    such protection, so it is done here.

    `location` is compared by reference because `updateSpaceInCache` clones the space and carries it
    through untouched; everything else is plain data and compares as JSON. A row whose content
    genuinely changed still gets a new object, and still remounts — which is correct, and why the

   * somebody arranged in it. Written at creation rather than materialised on the first drag, which
   * was the alternative: lazy creation means two members dragging at the same moment both find no

   * under them — `taskStates` is a memo returning fresh objects and `<For>` is reference-keyed, so
   * every column would remount and re-issue its subscription. Creating a board is already a
   * deliberate act by one person; doing the work there costs one round trip and avoids both.

   * not appear on a board made earlier. The work in it is not lost — it lands in the unplaced
   * column, which is what that column is for — and the board's own "add column" offers the state.

  /**
   * Withdraw a signal type from use, or bring it back — without touching what people gave.
   *
   * ## Why this is not a delete
   *
   * A `Signal` names its type by **record id** (`signalTypeId`), not by slug, while every template
   * resolves the type by slug at render time — `find(local.signalTypes, { slug: 'like' }).id`.
   * Three things follow, and they decide the whole design:
   *
   * - Deleting the type removes nothing. Every reaction ever given stays in the perspective, now
   *   naming an id nothing resolves, counted by no projection and rendered by nothing.
   * - Re-creating a type with the same slug does not bring them back either. AD4M mints a fresh
   *   record id, so the old rows still name the dead one. "Delete it and add it back" loses the
   *   history permanently, which is exactly the thing a person would expect to be safe.
   * - Cascading the delete instead — sweeping up every `Signal` with that id — is worse than it
   *   looks. It is thousands of sequential link removals in an established space; it destroys
   *   *other members'* expressions on one person's click, in a neighbourhood every member can write
   *   to; it cannot be undone; and it cannot even be guaranteed, since a peer who was offline
   *   during the sweep, or who reacted concurrently, re-orphans immediately.
   *
   * So the reversible option is the right one, and it is the one this codebase already chose one
   * layer up: `shapeStore.deleteShape` removes a model definition and says plainly that "records
   * already created keep their data — only the definition goes". A signal type is the same kind of
   * thing, and deserves the same answer.
   *
   * Retired, the type stops being offered anywhere a reaction can be given. The signals stay,
   * `find()` by slug still resolves it so existing counts keep working, and un-retiring restores
   * every reaction exactly as it was — because nothing was ever removed.
   *
   * Positively phrased so a switch can pass `event.detail` bare, matching `setAgentMuted` and
   * `setViewVisible`.
