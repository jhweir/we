   * Anything pinned to a screen edge has to move when a dock takes that edge, and the things that
   * need to move — the module rail, the editor's floating toolbar, the call bar — live in three
   * different packages, none of which has any business importing this store. A custom property on
   * the root is the one channel all of them already share; `--we-sidebar-width` is set the same way
   * and for the same reason.
   *
   * ## Composed here, deliberately
   *
   * These used to be `--we-dock-<edge>`: the dock inset alone, leaving each consumer to add whatever
   * else held its edge. Nobody added the same list. The module rail summed the dock and a panel's
   * title band; the editing bar summed the dock and the rail's width and *forgot the vertical term
   * entirely*, so a panel docked along the top covered it; the call module's main bar composed the
   * sidebar into its centring while the two smaller bars beside it — the join prompt and the problem
   * alert — centred on the window and cleared nothing at all. Four consumers, four different sums,
   * three of them wrong, and each one wrong in a way that only shows in one arrangement.
   *
   * So the shell publishes the answer rather than the ingredients. `contentInset` and
   * `computeLeftOffset` in TemplateLayout are the same four numbers the content viewport is laid out
   * from — chrome now reads exactly what the content reads, which is what "sit beside the content"
   * should have meant all along. The one term that stays a consumer's own is `--we-chrome-rail-width`,
   * and it has to: the rail is chrome at that edge, so the rail must *not* clear itself while
   * everything outside it must.
   *
   * The left edge composes with the sidebar rather than replacing it — a left dock opens beside the
   * sidebar, not over it — and does so in CSS so `--we-sidebar-width` stays the only place that
   * width is decided.

      rather than the way out. The sidebar is never the answer, being navigation and 80px wide.

   * maximised panel — or one snapped along the top — had its position menu and its un-maximise button
   * underneath it. The panel cannot dodge the rail without giving up a column of width for chrome
   * that is a few hundred pixels tall, so the rail moves, which is what this is for and what the
   * right edge already does with `--we-chrome-right`.
   *
   * ## Only when something is actually under the rail
   *
   * This used to fire for *any* open panel, wherever it was. Starting a call opens the video panel,
   * so the rail dropped 98px the moment a call began — with the video floating in the bottom left,
   * nowhere near it, and nothing on screen to explain why the rail had moved. The band is real but
   * it is a collision, and a collision has a location.
   *
   * So it asks the resolved boxes instead. Since a floating panel now clears the rail on its own
   * (`floatChrome`) and a displacing one has already slid it aside, the answer is normally no — what
   * remains is a maximised panel, which spans the content region including the rail's column, and
   * which is the case the band was written for.
   *
   * ## Two things a naive overlap test gets wrong
   *
   * **A shared edge is not an overlap.** A panel docked on the right ends exactly where the rail
   * begins, so the two touch by definition — and the two numbers being compared come from different
   * places: the resolved box rounds its width to whole pixels and `contentInset` does not. So the
   * test flipped on the fractional part of a drag, and resizing a right-hand panel made the rail
   * flicker between its two positions once per pixel. Hence a tolerance rather than a strict
   * inequality: a couple of pixels of contact is two boxes meeting, not one covering the other.
   *
   * **The band is a distance, not a flag.** It was a constant, so a panel whose titlebar sat at the
   * very top pushed the rail down as far as one sitting below the call bar — which read as the rail
   * parking itself an arbitrary distance from the top with nothing in the gap. It is measured from
   * the panel now: far enough to clear that titlebar and no further, capped so a panel somewhere
   * unexpected can never push the rail off the screen.

    This store publishes a dock of its own — the space-settings panel — so it has to be findable by
    the same lookup a module's store is. See `hostDockStores`, and `EditorStore` doing the same.

    Safe despite this being the store that *resolves* docks: `dockRequests` reads the accessor and
    the accessor writes nothing, so the dependency runs one way. It matters that the registration is
    here, after `store` exists and after `onDockRegistryChanged` is subscribed above — announcing
    into a listener that has not been added yet would leave the memo with nothing to re-run for,
    which is the failure the registry's own docblock describes.
