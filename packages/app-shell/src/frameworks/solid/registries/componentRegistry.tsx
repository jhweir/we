 *
 * This is code-splitting inside one build, not loading separately-built bundles: Rollup still gives
 * every chunk the same `solid-js`, so the single-instance guarantee the module system depends on is
 * untouched — see the note in `bundledModules.ts`, which is about the other thing.

    A read-only code view, and CodeMirror behind it.

    Registered because the generated component reference already documents `CodeEditor` as available
    to schemas, and it was not — so a schema reaching for it rendered nothing at all, silently. The
    docs promised it; this makes the promise true.

    NOT `lazy()`, though it is the largest thing here. It was, and the wrapper was inert:
    `@we/components` builds with `splitting: false`, so `@we/components/solid` is a single module —
    and this file, along with a dozen others in the shell, already imports it statically for `Column`
    and `Row`. Rollup said so on every app build (INEFFECTIVE_DYNAMIC_IMPORT) and split nothing.

    Nothing moves by dropping it: `CodeEditor` fetches CodeMirror itself, in `onMount`, so the
    ~270 KB stays out of the eager graph either way. The deferral belongs in the component, which is
    the only place it survives a consumer that also wants a `Column`.

    Testing.

    A perf debugging tool — logging on every mount is its purpose, which is exactly why production
    templates should not be able to reach it.

    Build-gated rather than gated on `sessionStore.devTools`, and deliberately not moved onto that
    switch with the rest of the developer affordances. The switch governs what *chrome* shows; this
    is a word in the vocabulary a template is rendered against, and the registry is built once. A
    template naming an unregistered component renders nothing and warns, which is the right answer
    for a production build and the wrong one for a developer who has merely muted their own tools.
