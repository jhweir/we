/**
 * The host services a module store may borrow, bound late.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * Modules are registered in `PlatformProvider`, which sits *above* `StoreProvider` — the launcher
 * template has to be in the registry before the stores render, so registration cannot wait. But the
 * ports a module wants (transport, presence, the current dataset) all live in stores that do not
 * exist yet at that moment.
 *
 * Rather than reorder the tree, the deps handed to a module store are **stable objects whose methods
 * dereference at call time**. A module holds `deps.presence` forever; what it points at is filled in
 * when `PresenceStoreProvider` mounts. Every accessor answers safely before then — `peers()` returns
 * an empty array, `ephemeral()` returns `null` — which is the same degrade-don't-throw contract the
 * ports already require for a personal space with no neighbourhood.
 *
 * The alternative — activating modules after the stores mount — was rejected because it splits
 * registration into two phases with different capabilities, and "which phase am I in" is exactly the
 * kind of implicit state the last round of seam bugs came from.
