/**
 * Dock Registry — module panels that take room from the app rather than covering it.
 *
 * The sibling of `slotRegistry`, and the distinction between them is the whole point. A slot is
 * chrome that **overlays**: it positions itself and whatever is beneath carries on underneath. A
 * dock **insets**: the host shrinks the content viewport by exactly as much as the dock occupies, so
 * a panel and the space can be used at the same time.
 *
 * That mechanism already existed — `TemplateLayout.computeRightOffset` shrinks the viewport for the
 * theme and template editor's rails, and `PersistentAppFrames` reads the same number so embedded
 * apps line up. It was hardcoded to the editor. This generalises it: any module can contribute, and
 * the editor's own offsets are still summed alongside.
 *
 * ## Anchors group, docks position
 *
 * `slotRegistry`'s docblock notes that an anchor is semantic metadata — it orders and groups, and
 * the contributed node positions itself, because WE's shell nodes always have. It also notes that a
 * future anchor *could* emit a container, and that doing so would be a deliberate behaviour change
 * rather than something to smuggle in. This is that change, made in a new registry rather than by
 * altering what an anchor means, so nothing that renders through a slot today moves.
 *
 * A dock therefore does not position itself. It says which edge and how big; the host owns where
 * that lands, what it has to clear (the sidebar on the left, the module rail on the right), what
 * the content viewport becomes, and what happens on a window too narrow to give anything up. That
 * is not tidiness: a module cannot see the sidebar's width or the rail's, and the call module was
 * carrying `right: '72px'` — a hardcoded copy of geometry it had no way to keep in step.

 * overlaid in a corner would sooner or later land on one of them.
 *
 * It is also the whole keyboard story. The grip is focusable and moves the panel by arrow key, and
 * the menu names all eight positions outright — so nothing about placing a panel requires a pointer,
 * which a drag-only design would have quietly made true.
 *
 * Padded, and taller than the controls inside it. A 24px bar holding a 24px button put that button's
 * corner exactly where the panel's own 16px radius clips, so the menu trigger came out shaved on two
 * sides; 4px of vertical padding and 8px of horizontal is enough to clear the curve at the height the
 * button actually occupies.

 * Three of the titlebar's controls do nothing at all in full screen, and each does nothing in a way
 * that is worse than inert. Fitting to content writes a width and height the maximised box ignores.
 * The displace toggle writes a flag it ignores. The position menu ticks a snap that decides only
 * where the panel will land *later*, so choosing one changes something invisible now and surprising
 * on the way back out.
 *
 * Hidden rather than disabled, which is the same choice `fitButton` already makes for a module that
 * publishes no aspect — "a control that did nothing would be worse than one that is not there".
 * Disabling would keep the titlebar's composition stable, and the usual argument for that is a
 * toggle staying under the cursor between presses. It does not apply here: maximising relocates the
 * whole titlebar to the top of the window, so nothing is where it was regardless.
 *
 * What stays is what still means something. The grip, because dragging a maximised panel pulls it
 * back out — one of the two ways to leave. The maximise toggle, which is the other. And close.

 * anybody has used puts it.
 *
 * ## A tab is a click until it is a drag
 *
 * Each is a `we-move-handle` on `beginTabDrag`/`moveTab`/`endTabDrag` rather than on the ordinary
 * move path, and the difference is that those three do nothing on the press. They have to: acting on
 * a press destroys the element holding the pointer capture, because raising a tab hides the frame
 * this strip lives in and tearing one out of a seat of two takes the strip away with it. Wired
 * straight to `beginDockMove`, a click on a background tab put the drag guides up and left them
 * there, and the tab never changed.
 *
 * So the press records, the pointer has to travel before anything happens, and the panel stays in
 * its seat until the drop — which is how every tab strip behaves, and what keeps this element alive
 * for the whole gesture. A press that goes nowhere brings the tab forward; one that travels shows
 * where it would land, and over nothing leaves it as a card under the pointer.
 *
 * `step: 0` is what keeps the keyboard sane. The handle emits a whole gesture per arrow key, and at
 * the usual 24px that is past the threshold — so every arrow press would tear the panel out of its
 * seat. At zero the gesture goes nowhere, which `endTabDrag` reads as the click it is, so the arrow
 * keys *switch tabs*; moving a panel from the keyboard stays with the titlebar's own grip.
 *
 * The visual is on a wrapper rather than on the handle: `we-move-handle` is a `LayoutElement`, so it
 * takes no `bg` or `r`, and putting the roles on a `Row` keeps them as design-system props instead of
 * raw custom properties in a `styles` bag.
