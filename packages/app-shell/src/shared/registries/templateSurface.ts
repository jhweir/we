/**
 * What a template is allowed to say — the trust boundary, as data.
 *
 * ## The problem this exists for
 *
 * Templates and themes arrive from a marketplace or sync in from peers, and are then rendered with
 * whatever the host put in the store bag. Every member of every store was in that bag: 388 of them,
 * including `runtimeStore.trustAgent`, `runtimeStore.importDatabase`, `accountStore.removeAccount`,
 * `sessionStore.token` and `datasetStore.agentSettings` (which carries the Claude API key). A
 * template that renders normally could log you out, wipe a space, trust an attacker's DID, or put
 * your API key in a URL — as a side effect of painting, with no click and no user intent.
 *
 * VISION's claim is that a template is *safe to install from a stranger*. Nothing enforced that.
 * This file is the enforcement, and it is deliberately one file: an allowlist scattered across
 * thirteen stores is not reviewable, and the whole point is that a person can read it.
 *
 * ## How it holds together
 *
 * - **Absent, not blocked.** A member the tier does not grant is simply not in the bag. That
 *   matches the renderer's existing semantics — an unresolvable path is `undefined`, a reference to
 *   an uninstalled module resolves to nothing — and leaves a hostile template no error channel to
 *   probe.
 * - **State is tagged, actions are not.** Only members declared `state` are marked with
 *   `markReactive`, and `walkPath` now calls only tagged accessors. That closes the other half of
 *   the hole: a store read used to *invoke* any function it walked past, so naming a zero-argument
 *   method in one called it during paint.
 * - **Groups are the grant unit, per-member declarations are the mechanism.** Nobody can review a
 *   list of 388 method names; "this template can manage your library and your account" is
 *   reviewable. Groups are what a marketplace listing will show a human when chrome templates
 *   become installable.
 * - **`destructive` cuts across groups**, so a host can demand its own confirmation for those
 *   regardless of tier — in host chrome, where a theme's CSS cannot restyle it.
 *
 * ## Keeping it honest
 *
 * `templateSurface.test.ts` asserts that every member of every store interface appears here. A new
 * store member fails that test until it is classified, so this cannot quietly fall behind the code
 * it describes — the failure mode an allowlist beside the thing it allows usually has.
 */

/**
 * What a group of capabilities lets a template do, in the words a person would use.
 *
 * Additive by contract: adding a member to a group is a minor change, moving or removing one is
 * breaking, the same discipline the schema operators follow. These names will end up in front of
 * users at install time, so they are written for that rather than for the code they gate.

    templates are meant to reach, not store state anyone needs protecting from. Its members are pure
    synchronous functions the host chose to register, so there is nothing here to gate — a template
    that can call `calendarMonth` can compute a month, which is the entire point of registering it.

    Left unclassified it was simply dropped, silently, exactly as this file's own rule says an

    host", which reads as a missing registration rather than a withheld one.

 * which is which. Tagging all of them keeps `{ $: 'modules.transcribe.level' }` working and
 * leaves `modules.call.leave` callable during paint, exactly as before.
 *
 * The reason that is acceptable *today* is that modules are bundled: they are chosen by the
 * deployment's seed and ship with the app, at the same trust level as the app itself. It stops being
 * acceptable the moment modules are installable, which the module docs already anticipate — and the
 * fix has a clear shape: `ModuleStoreDeps` grows a `state()` marker, modules wrap their accessors in
 * it, and this function tags only what was marked. Left as a follow-up rather than done here because
 * it is a contract change across five modules, and doing it badly would be worse than doing it late.
