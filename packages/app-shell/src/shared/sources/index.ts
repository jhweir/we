/**
 * The functions this host lends to templates, beyond the schema language's built-in library.
 *
 * ## Why a table and not four exports
 *
 * These reach a template as functions in an expression — `calendarMonth({ month: local.month })` —
 * resolved against the `$sources` bag at paint.
 * What neither can do is tell an author the name exists. The graph plugins had exactly this
 * problem: a good protocol, no catalogue in the generated context, so an LLM could not write a
 * globe template. A host function that is not in the context is one an author has to already know.
 *
 * So each entry carries what the generated reference needs — the signature, a sentence, an
 * example — in the same shape `defineFunction` uses for the built-ins, and `@we/ai-context` reads
 * this file to list them beside those. The validator reads the same list, which is how a call to a
 * source stops being a warning and a typo in one starts being.
 *
 * A module that wants to lend a function contributes an entry here for now; when modules become
 * installable it becomes a declaration on the module contract, catalogued the same way.
