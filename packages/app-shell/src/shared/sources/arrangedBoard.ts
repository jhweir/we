/**
 * A board, worked out: which records each column shows, in what order, and what is left over.
 *
 * ## Why a host function and not expressions
 *
 * The first version of the board computed all of this in the expression language — a nested
 * comprehension per column, an `exists` inside a `filter` inside a `map`, the same string inlined in
 * a heading's count, an `$each`'s items and the Unplaced column's condition. It validated, and twice
 * it computed the wrong thing where nothing could see: `+` coerced two lists to `0`, and a nested
 * include that the backend refused left every card in Unplaced. The tests that caught those were
 * tests of a small query engine written in a language with no types.
 *
 * The routing table sends computation the library lacks to a function the host registers. That is
 * what this is. The fragment is arrangement again — an `$each` over `.columns`, a card per row — and
 * the meaning sits here, where it is typed, tested directly, and evaluated once per input change
 * rather than once per expression.
 *
 * ## What it decides
 *
 * **State is a fact about the work; position is a fact about the pair.** A column shows the records
 * whose `status` matches its `slug` — a query — in the order its `arranges` puts them, then whatever
 * matches that nobody has arranged. A column with no slug is a **lane**: it shows only what it
 * arranges, and gathers nothing. A record arranged in a lane is excluded from the state columns on
 * this board, or it would appear twice.
 *
 * A stale hint — a record still listed by a column whose slug no longer matches its status — is
 * ignored, and the record falls back to being unarranged in whichever column its state now names.
 * Reading "placed" as *placed somewhere that shows it* is what keeps a stale hint from hiding work.
 *
 * Whether the board **gathers** is read off the board itself: `gathers` names the Space or the
 * container it draws from, and empty means the board shows only what it holds. A made board's
 * membership is the union of its columns' `arranges` and its own — no separate relation to keep in
 * step — and which column shows a member is still its state.
 *
 * **Unplaced** is the work in scope that no column here can show: a state no column names, and not
 * sitting in a lane. Filtering it out would be tidier and would hide work, which is the one failure
 * the design exists to prevent. `unplacedStates` are the states that work is in, so the board can
 * offer a column for each.
 *
 * ## Identity
 *
 * `columns` are the caller's own column records, reordered — never copies. The renderer's `$each`
 * keys rows by reference, so a fresh object per column per push would remount every column, and the
 * sortable inside it, on every change anywhere on the board. The same holds for the records in
 * `arranged`, `unarranged` and `unplaced`: the caller's objects, filtered. Per-column results live in
 * `contents`, keyed by id, so a column reads its own without the list changing identity.
 *
 * ## The two subscriptions it reads
 *
 * `board` supplies the column *order* — its hydrated `children` — and `columns` supplies their
 * *contents*. Two subscriptions rather than one, and the split is what makes the board update at
 * all: a card moving between columns changes a column's links and not the board's, so a subscription
 * on the board alone is not obliged to re-run, and a card hydrated through the board's `include`
 * could stay as it was until something else invalidated the query. Each subscription covers exactly
 * what changes under it. That is the client library's invalidation behaviour, not WE's, and it is
 * recorded here so the fragment need not carry it.
