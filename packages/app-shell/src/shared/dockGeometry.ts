/**
 * Where a module panel lands, how big it is, and whether the app gives up room for it.
 *
 * Pure functions over a viewport and a list of docks, deliberately: this is the one place that
 * knows the shell's geometry — the sidebar on the left, how wide "medium" is, where a panel snaps,
 * and when the window is too narrow to inset anything at all. A module says whether its panel is
 * open and how much it would like; everything else is here, where it can be reasoned about and
 * tested without a browser.
 *
 * ## One panel, two behaviours, and the question that separates them
 *
 * A panel either **covers** the app or **displaces** it, and that used to be decided by which of six
 * placements a module named — four edges that always spanned their whole edge and insetted, plus a
 * float and a full screen that always overlaid. Position and displacement were one enum, so a small
 * call among three people still cost a full-height column of the window to put beside the content.
 *
 * They are separate questions now. **Where** is a position the user drags, optionally snapping to one
 * of eight targets. **Whether it displaces** is a toggle. The two meet in one rule:
 *
 * > **A panel that displaces spans its lane; a panel that floats does not.**
 *
 * Which is not a restriction but an honesty: a rectangular layout cannot flow around a floating box,
 * so insetting the content for a panel snapped to a *corner* would carve out a full column and leave
 * most of it empty. So displacing is offered on the four edge-centre snaps only, and turning it on
 * makes the panel span its lane across that edge — becoming exactly the dock this file used to
 * describe, whenever it is the only panel in that lane.
 *
 * ## An edge is two axes, not two arrangements
 *
 * Which lane, and where along it. A **lane** is a band across the edge, counting inward from it; the
 * panels sharing one divide it along its length. Two coordinates, `band` and `order`, each meaning
 * one thing (see {@link FloatPlacement}), and between them they say everything an edge can hold:
 *
 * ```
 *  lanes of one panel each          one lane of two            a lane of one, then a lane of two
 *  ┌────┬────┬──────────┐    ┌─────────┬──────────┐     ┌────┬─────┬──────────┐
 *  │    │    │          │    │    A    │          │     │    │  B  │          │
 *  │ A  │ B  │ content  │    ├─────────┤ content  │     │ A  ├─────┤ content  │
 *  │    │    │          │    │    B    │          │     │    │  C  │          │
 *  └────┴────┴──────────┘    └─────────┴──────────┘     └────┴─────┴──────────┘
 * ```
 *
 * The first two are what this file used to be able to draw, and it drew each of them from a different
 * field: a displacing panel read `order` as *how far inboard* and stacked; a floating one read the
 * same number as *where along the edge* and divided. So which arrangement you got was decided by the
 * `displace` flag — a question about whether a panel takes room, answering a question about where it
 * sits — and the third picture was unreachable from either side. `band` is the coordinate that was
 * missing; `order` now means one thing wherever it appears.
 *
 * Floating panels have one lane per edge and no `band` at all: nothing takes room from them, so there
 * is nothing to be inboard of. {@link edgeGroups} is where the whole rule lives, and every function
 * here that used to ask "does this panel displace" to decide an arrangement asks that instead.
 *
 * See `registries/dockRegistry.ts` for why a module does not position itself.

 * real offers and both contain the pointer at the top-left corner, so something has to choose, and
 * the honest rule is the one this file already stated for gaps over edge targets: **the more
 * specific answer is the one the user is pointing at.**
 *
 * Specific is measurable — it is the smaller box. A lane's seam is 300×20 where the edge band behind
 * it is 1520×24, and a seat's "make a tab of this" region is half a panel, so ranking by size gets
 * every pair right without a table of kinds to keep in step as kinds are added. Ranked by *area
 * covered* instead, the band won every time and the seam above a docked sidebar could not be reached
 * at all: dropping above the top panel of a left-hand stack silently docked to the top of the screen.
 *
 * ## And the panel's own rectangle, when the pointer is over nothing
 *
 * The fallback is the rule this replaced, kept for the case it was written for: a panel wide enough
 * to lie over two lines at once, with the pointer between them, takes the one it covers most rather
 * than the first in the list. Lines are preferred to regions there, since a boundary is still the

 * axis wins — and it read as two different features depending on which axis had the slack. A panel
 * too tall lost height, which is what people expect; a panel too *wide* gained height so the picture
 * could grow into it, so the button appeared to enlarge the video nobody had asked it to touch.
 *
 * The rule now is one sentence: **the picture stays the size it is, and whichever side has slack
 * loses it.** So it only ever subtracts, it does the same thing whichever way the panel was dragged,
 * and pressing it twice does nothing the second time.
 *
 * A displacing panel is the one case that can grow, and unavoidably: it spans its edge, so the axis
 * with the slack is the one it does not own. Its thickness is set so the content fills the span
 * instead — the same idea ("no empty band"), expressed on the only dimension the panel has.
 *
 * And that growth is bounded, which it was not. A spanning fit solves `span × ratio`, so a wide
 * content shape against a tall edge asks for a thickness far past anything the screen has: the call
 * stage on a 4K side edge wanted 3761px of a 3760px region for a *single* 16:9 tile, and worse for
 * every arrangement above one. The number was written anyway and `resolveDock` clamped it at paint
 * time, so the panel covered the region, the clamp hid why, and the value persisted — invisible
 * while the panel floated, since a float reads `w`/`h` and never a thickness, and waiting to take
 * over the moment it displaced again.
 *
 * Given `maxThickness`, a fit that cannot be honoured within it **declines** instead. Clamping would
 * be worse than doing nothing: it destroys the size the user chose and still leaves the band, since a
 * panel at the full width of its edge is exactly as letterboxed as it was. Nothing is written, so the
 * button is a no-op — which is what it already is on a panel that is right the first time.
 *
 * The bound is the caller's, and the answer that means something is `dockThickness` at `lg` — the
 * largest size a dock is ever *asked* for. Bounding at the whole region instead is barely a bound at
 * all: on a 4K side edge it still let one 16:9 tile take 92% of the screen, which is the complaint
 * rather than the fix. A panel wanting more room than the largest named dock is not asking to be
 * fitted, it is asking to be maximised, and there is a control for that.

/**
 * Everything on one edge, grouped into lanes, outboard first — the whole arrangement rule, in one

 *
 * ## What a lane is
 *
 * A band across the edge, counting inward from it, whose panels divide it along its length. Every
 * function here that places a panel against its neighbours asks this and nothing else: `occupiedFor`
 * and `contentInset` walk the lanes to add up what the content gave away, `columnLayout` divides one
 * lane between its members, and the shell hands each panel its seat.
 *
 * ## Membership is implied, and lane-mateship is not
 *
 * Which edge a panel is on comes from its snap — two panels snapped `left` are on the left edge and
 * nothing else has to say so. Which *lane* it is in does not: `band` is absent until somebody puts it
 * somewhere, and **a displacing panel with no band is alone in a lane of its own**.
 *
 * That asymmetry is the whole of the backwards compatibility. Two module panels opening on one edge,
 * neither of them ever arranged, are two lanes and stack inward exactly as they always did — rather
 * than becoming lane-mates and halving each other the first time both are open. Sharing a lane is
 * something a drop or a template asks for.
 *
 * Unnamed lanes sort after named ones, by `order` and then by the position they were handed in — the
 * registry's. Which is the rule this replaced, said about lanes instead of about panels: somebody's
 * arrangement first, then everything else in the order it registered, and a panel that arrives
 * without being dropped anywhere lands at the end.
 *
 * ## The floating lane
 *
 * One per edge, last, and it has no `band`. A float takes no room, so there is nothing for it to sit
 * inboard of — every floating panel on an edge shares the one lane, over the top of whatever is
 * displacing there. This is the column the file could already draw.
 *
 * Corners are deliberately absent from all of it: `top-left` is a place for one card, and a corner
 * that divided itself would have no edge to divide along.

      It used to stop short of the sidebar, the module rail and the call bar's band, on the reasoning
      that "full screen cannot mean the whole screen while the app keeps permanent chrome over it".
      The reasoning was right about what must not be covered and wrong about what to do with it. What
      must not be covered is the panel's own titlebar — grip, position menu, un-maximise — because
      that is the way out. Reserving a *band* along each edge for it protected far more than the
      titlebar and, worse, protected the wrong shape: the rail is a short column at top-right and the
      call bar a centred pill, so most of each reserved strip was empty and showed whatever the
      template had behind it. A panel that covers everything except a frame of unrelated content is
      not what anybody presses that button for.

      Two things make covering everything safe now. The call bar sits at the *bottom*, where a
      panel has no controls; and the module rail already drops below a maximised panel's titlebar on
      its own, through `--we-panel-chrome-top` — the band this file computes in `railBand`. So both
      pieces of chrome stay reachable, painted over the panel rather than beside it, and neither
      lands on anything the panel is recovered with.

      `occupied` is still subtracted, and that line is deliberate. Permanent furniture — the sidebar,
      the rail — is the app's own and covering it is what "full screen" means. Another *displacing*
      panel is something the user opened, which is currently shrinking the content for a reason;
      covering that is losing something rather than filling the screen.

 *
 * ## The stacking exemption, and who it is for
 *
 * Displacing lanes on one edge take turns: a lane steps past the ones outboard of it and ignores the
 * ones inboard — otherwise each dodges the other and they leave a gap between them.
 *
 * That exemption belongs to panels *in* that queue. A floating panel is not holding the edge, it is
 * keeping off it, so it clears every displacing lane there whatever order they registered in. Asking
 * the wrong question had an oddly specific symptom: a video snapped to the right stayed behind a
 * notes panel that opened on the same edge, while its landing markers moved correctly — because a
 * panel mid-drag has no snap, so the exemption could not fire until the moment it was dropped.
 *
 * ## Why the whole ordering question moved to `edgeGroups`
 *
 * This used to carry its own comparison — `order`, then registry position — and a long note about
 * why it had to be a *total* order: two panels that each believe the other is behind them both shift
 * by the other's thickness, which overlaps them in the middle and leaves a gap at the edge. Lanes
 * make that structural rather than arithmetical. `edgeGroups` returns them in one fixed sequence, and
 * "outboard of me" is a position in a list, which cannot be ambiguous the way a pairwise comparison
 * could. The rule it encodes is the same one, said once: somebody's arrangement first, then
 * everything else in the order it registered.
 *
 * `chrome` is room taken by something that is not a panel at all — the editor's rails, which displace
 * content exactly as a dock does and are not docks.

 * slightly nearer a panel than intended, rather than being crowded out of a region nothing occupies.

 * the rail into the call controls and prints it across them. Nothing else in the layout has this
 * shape, which is why this is the only collision the shell computes.
 *
 * ## Why panels are not considered
 *
 * They were, and it was dead code that could only fire when it was wrong. By the time this is asked,
 * no panel can be under the rail:
 *
 * - one displacing left or right has already slid it sideways, through `--we-chrome-right`;
 * - one displacing top or bottom has already pushed it down, through `--we-chrome-top`;
 * - a floating or snapped one is clamped out of its column by `DEFAULT_FLOAT_CHROME`;
 * - a maximised one covers the whole window, and the rail hides rather than dodging it.
 *
 * That last bullet was briefly a term in this function — the rail dropped below a maximised panel's
 * titlebar so it stayed reachable over the top of it. Hiding is the better answer and made the term
 * dead: full screen means the app's own furniture is gone, and the way back out is the panel's
 * titlebar and the Escape key. See `shellStore.panelMaximised`.
 *
 * So a panel could only ever be found here through a *disagreement* between two ways of measuring
 * one edge — a resolved box rounding where an inset does not, say — and what it reported then was
 * not a real overlap but the depth of whatever it had mismeasured, which for anything but a top-edge
 * panel is hundreds of pixels. That is how a rail asked to clear a bar 74px tall ended up parked
 * halfway down the screen.
