/**
 * Reading a collection's children back as a transcript.
 *
 * This is the host's job rather than the module's, and that is a consequence of the module contract
 * rather than a preference: `createEntity` and `linkEntity` are its entire data surface, with no read
 * at all. So a module can write utterances into a call and cannot read them out — which is exactly
 * what interpreting them needs. Rather than widen the contract with a general query (a much larger
 * decision, and one that wants an answer for reactivity and permissions first), the host gathers the
 * turns and the module asks for a collection by id.
 *
 * That split is also the honest one. Only the host knows how a WE collection is laid out; a module
 * that assembled turns itself would be hard-coding `we://children` and the block vocabulary, which
 * is precisely the backend knowledge modules are kept away from.
 *
 * Every agent transcribes only their own microphone, so a child's author *is* its speaker and no
 * diarization is involved. That is a property of how transcription was built, and it is what makes
 * speaker attribution here free and correct rather than inferred.

    That is not a correct ordering and cannot be made one from here: every agent transcribes their

    NTP produce a transcript with the replies before the questions. Fixing it properly needs a
    logical clock on the utterance, which is a change to what a `TextBlock` in a call carries and
    belongs with the content layer rather than in a sort.

    What the tiebreak *does* fix is the half that was gratuitous: equal timestamps previously came
    out in whatever order the per-entity queries returned, so two agents reading the same call could
    see a different transcript, and the prompt built from it differed between the peers running
    extraction. Same input, same order, on every machine.
