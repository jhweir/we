/**
 * Turning a model into a display — the read-side counterpart of `recordDraft.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A content type in WE is a model and two components: one to show an instance, one to edit it. The
 * model is a declaration — a manifest, or a shape a community wrote — and can arrive from anyone.
 * The two components are Solid code, and are the only reason a content type cannot. `recordDraft`
 * already replaced the *input* component for any declared model: a form exists for a model nobody
 * wrote a form for. This replaces the *display* one — a card exists for a model nobody wrote a card
 * for — which is what lets a content type be manifest + fragments all the way down, and cross the
 * trust boundary as data.
 *
 * That is the second rung of the distribution ladder in `docs/internal/plans/module-marketplace.md`,
 * and this is its first step: the derivation. The manifest grows `display` hints for what a form
 * does not need — which property is the title, which the summary, which the picture — and this
 * guesses sensibly without them.
 *
 * Pure and framework-free, for the same reason its sibling is: the mapping from a declaration to
 * something on screen is the part with rules in it, and it is worth testing without mounting
 * anything. A template reads the result through `recordStore.displays` and renders it with ordinary
 * `$each` and `$if` — see the "A record of any type" pattern in the generated reference.
