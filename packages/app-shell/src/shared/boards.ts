/**
 * What a board write means.
 *
 * A board's columns are records: the board's ordered `children` are its columns, and each column's
 * ordered `arranges` are the cards somebody put in it. The reasoning — why a column is a saved query
 * with an arrangement rather than a container, why arrangement is its own relation rather than more
 * meaning on `children`, and why that is what survives a partition — is `docs/architecture/boards.md`.
 *
 * **The ordering is not here.** An ordered relation is an RGA in the executor: it diffs a written
 * list against what it holds, records only what moved, and converges when two people drag at the
 * same moment. Nothing in this file indexes, renumbers, merges or breaks a tie — which is the whole
 * reason a column's arrangement is a relation rather than a `position` scalar on each card.
 *
 * What *is* here is everything a backend cannot be asked: which list to store (the visible order,
 * then the hints the screen no longer shows), what a drop means (up to three writes, the third
 * conditional on whether the target column names a state), the invariants only WE knows (a board's
 * children are columns; a board says what it gathers), and when a shared record is allowed to come
 * into being.
 *
 * Framework-neutral, per `CONVENTIONS.md`: the three things that reach outside — which dataset, what
 * the community's states are, and how a failure reaches a person — arrive as `BoardDeps` rather than
 * as imports.
