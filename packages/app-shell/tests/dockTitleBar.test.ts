/**
 * Which of a panel's controls mean anything in full screen.
 *
 * Three of them do not, and each does nothing in a way that is worse than inert: fit-to-content
 * writes a width the maximised box ignores, the displace toggle writes a flag it ignores, and the
 * position menu ticks a snap that decides only where the panel lands *later* — so using it changes
 * something invisible now and surprising on the way back out.
 *
 * Asserted against the schema rather than a render, for the same reason the layering test is: the
 * titlebar's composition is a static decision, and what this is protecting is the *condition* each
 * control is gated on rather than anything about how it draws.
