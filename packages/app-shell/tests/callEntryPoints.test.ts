/**
 * What every way into a call does when you are already in one.
 *
 * There are three of them — the module rail's launcher, the Cards header's Call button, and the
 * Continue button on each call card — and until this file existed all three assumed there was no
 * call running. Each one was wrong in its own way, and none of the three failures was visible from
 * the declaration:
 *
 * - a bare join returns early on the call you are already in, so the control was silently dead.
 * - On any *other* call — one anchored to a post, or one in a space you had navigated away from —
 *   the ids differ, so it tore that call down to start a new one. No confirmation.
 * - `resume` did not fail quietly at all. It re-pointed the live transcript at the record it was
 *   given and announced the claim, and peers adopt an announced record in preference to their own.
 *   A stray click on an old card moved everybody's live transcript into an old meeting. That action
 *   no longer exists — a continued call's activity says so and the transcriber adopts the record
 *   itself — so the test below asserts it stays gone rather than that it stays guarded.
 *
 * All three now make the same promise once a call is running: go to the call. These assert it on
 * the *serialised* schema, because that is the only thing that would notice someone reasonably
 * "simplifying" a branch back into the unconditional pair it replaced — a typecheck cannot, and the
 * schema validator checks shape rather than meaning.
