/**
 * A floating panel is glass; a displacing or maximised one is not.
 *
 * Asserted against the schema and against `resolveDock`'s own output, because the two halves fail
 * independently and both fail quietly. The frame's half is a condition on a store path — get the
 * path wrong and `$store` resolves to undefined, which is falsy, so every panel stays opaque and
 * looks exactly like a panel nobody had got round to styling. The geometry's half is the flag that
 * condition reads: `maximised` was added for this, and if it stops being set, a full-screen panel
 * turns translucent and blurs the whole window behind itself.
 *
 * Neither is covered anywhere else — `dockRegistry` is not under the schema validator's walk, which
 * only reaches `.schema.ts` files and what they import.
