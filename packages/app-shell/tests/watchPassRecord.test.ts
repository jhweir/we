/**
 * Which watched passes get written down, and as what.

 * The rule lives beside `detailWithheld` for the same reason that one does: it is a sentence about
 * rows, and every way of getting it wrong produces a *quiet* wrong answer — a duplicate line in a
 * log nobody counts, a history of who was watching rather than of what was read, or an entry whose
 * prompt is blank because it was read off the wrong event.
 *
 * The point of writing these at all is that a pass somebody pressed for and a pass a watch ran are
 * then one list, told apart by a flag rather than by which surface happens to be on screen.
