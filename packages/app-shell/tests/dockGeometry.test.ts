/**
 * Dock geometry — where a module panel lands, and what the app gives up for it.
 *
 * Worth testing directly rather than through a rendered shell, because every interesting case is a
 * decision about *whether* to give up room, and those are the cases a screenshot cannot tell apart:
 * a panel that floats and a panel that displaces look identical until you look at what is behind
 * them.
 *
 * The rule the whole file turns on: **a panel that displaces spans its edge; a panel that floats
 * does not.** Most of what follows is that sentence, from one side or the other.
