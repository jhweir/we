/**
 * Which panels are on screen: the shell's, the section's, and the route filter over both.
 *
 * Both decisions here fail invisibly. A section's panel outranking the shell's would rearrange an
 * interface that never asked for it, and a route filter that drops a panel it should have kept
 * *unregisters* the dock — so its scroll position, its subscriptions and wherever it had been
 * dragged are destroyed and rebuilt, which reads as a rendering glitch rather than as a filter
 * being wrong. Neither needs a router to decide, so neither needs one to test.
