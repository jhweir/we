/**
 * Editing a template from the picker takes one click, on any row that can be edited.
 *
 * It used to take three. The edit action was gated on the row being the one already on screen, so
 * the pencil beside every *other* template was simply absent — and the way to reach it was to pick
 * the template (which closed the menu), open the menu again, and click the pencil that had now
 * appeared. Two of those three steps existed only because of the gate.
 *
 * Worth a test rather than a comment because both halves fail silently and in opposite directions.
 * Gate on the wrong thing and the control vanishes, which reads as "not offered here" rather than
 * as a bug. Drop the switch from the click and it appears to work: an editing session opens, over
 * whichever template was current, and what you edit is not the row you clicked.
 *
 * Asserted against the schema for the reason `dockTitleBar` is: what is being protected is the
 * *condition* each control carries, not anything about how it draws.
