 * how a query's `scope` resolves a relation, and the host's own entities have to be in that list or
 * no drill-down through core vocabulary can ever resolve. That gap belonged to every backend
 * equally, so fixing it inside one adapter would have left the next to rediscover it.
 *
 * Deliberately does **not** bind storage languages. `manifestToEntries` in the AD4M adapter attaches
 * `FILE_STORAGE_LANGUAGE` to file-format properties, which is that backend's business and would be
 * wrong here; this produces the portable half, which is all `scope` resolution reads. An adapter
 * that needs the binding keeps compiling the manifest itself.
 *
 * Only declared predicates are emitted. A property with none is skipped rather than given a minted
 * one: minting is a backend's decision (and a module's namespace rule), and inventing one here would
 * produce an entry that resolves to a predicate nothing was ever written under — a drill-down that
 * silently returns nothing, which is worse than one that fails loudly.
