   * `Sighting`, write careful hints for it, and never have anything extract one: the hints were
   * stored, synced and editable, and nothing read them.
   *
   * ## Why it is opt-in, and why the flag has to be explicit
   *
   * Every selected entity puts its **whole shape** into the prompt, every property hinted or not,
   * so the target list is the cost *and* the quality control — a longer one is slower, dearer and
   * vaguer rather than more capable. `TextBlock` is the case that makes this concrete: it is what a
   * transcript is made of, and most of its shape is serialization (`indent`, `textFormat`,
   * `listType`), so offering it is offering a model a dozen fields it can only fill with noise.
   * And a model somebody curates by hand should not have an interpreter minting rows into it,
   * which is a decision only its author can make.
   *
   * Deriving it instead from "carries an interpretationHint" does not work and was tried on paper:
   * `Relationship` carries hints — it is a *target* of hint-driven work, not of extraction — so the
   * derivation admits exactly the entity that must never be admitted.
   *
   * ## Where it does not belong
   *
   * Not a property of the `Shape` record. That record is metadata *about* a definition document;
   * this is a fact about the entity, so it lives beside `interpretationHint` in the document
   * itself — which also means it travels with a shape that is copied or forked, as a record
   * property would not.
   *
   * ## What it does not decide
   *
   * Whether a *pass* targets it. The space's declared targets are the default set; a call may
   * narrow that (see the transcribe module), and a space may switch auto-extraction off entirely.
   * This says only that the entity is eligible.
   *
   * Absent means no, which is the right default: an entity becomes an extraction target by

  /**
   * A person can author one of these inline, as a unit of content inside a composed document.

   * "Entity" and "block" read as alternatives — they were two sibling directories in `@we/entities`
   * for a long time — but the manifest has only ever had one map, and every block is in it. A block
   * is not a different sort of declaration; it is an entity that answers yes to one extra question:
   * *can somebody make one of these fresh, inline, while writing a document?* `TaskBlock` says yes

   * infrastructure consequences that inline authoring cannot carry.
   *
   * Expressing that as a flag rather than a folder is what lets the rule below be checked. It also
   * stops the vocabulary implying a split that the data never had.
   *
   * ## What it obliges
   *
   * A `version`, checked by {@link validateManifest}. Blocks are edited collaboratively inside a
   * document, so conflict resolution needs a counter to compare; entities that are not composed
   * are written by one owner at a time and need none. That rule predates this flag — it was prose
   * in CONVENTIONS.md that nothing enforced, and the folder it keyed off could not enforce it.
   *
   * ## What it does not decide
   *
   * Whether the block editor can *render* one. That needs Display and Input components, registered
   * through `registerBlock()` in `@we/block-shared`. This flag is the data half of the same fact,
