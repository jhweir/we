/**
 * What an interpretation pass is doing, while it is doing it.
 *
 * Sibling to `interpretation.ts`, which is the *verb* side of the same capability: `interpret()`
 * runs a pass and resolves when it is over. This is the running commentary — who started one, how
 * far it has got, and what the model was actually asked.
 *
 * ## Why a pass needs a commentary at all
 *
 * Because the wait is long enough to look like a hang. A pass on a local model is seconds to
 * minutes, almost all of it inside one LLM call, and both existing surfaces report only the ends:
 * `interpret()` resolves at the end, and a standing watch has no return value at all. A user who
 * pressed Extract sees a spinner; a user in a call whose neighbour pressed it sees nothing
 * whatsoever. Neither can tell a slow model from a dead one.
 *
 * ## Why `mine` exists, and why it is not a detail
 *
 * A pass runs on exactly one peer. In a shared space that peer is chosen by an *election* — whoever
 * wins the claim — so which member ends up holding the rich view of a pass is arbitrary. Everyone
 * sees the row; only the runner can see inside it, and only the runner's backend can produce the
 * inside. {@link InterpretationActivity.mine} is how a UI tells those apart without asking the
 * backend a second question, and it is the difference between "expand for details" being an
 * affordance and being a broken button for everybody but one person.
 *
 * The asymmetry is the backend's, not ours: AD4M's fine-grained step stream is DID-filtered while
 * its neighbourhood stream is perspective-scoped, and neither crosses machines on its own. A host
 * that wants peers to see each other's passes relays them — see `interpretationRelay.ts`, which
 * does exactly that over {@link EphemeralPort} and sets `mine: false` on what it receives.
 *
 * ## Why the LLM payload is separate from the phase
 *
 * {@link InterpretationActivity.llm} is tens of KB and interesting for about five minutes, while
 * the phase is a few dozen bytes and is what every viewer needs. Keeping them in one object but
 * populating the payload only on request is what lets a host broadcast the cheap half continuously
 * and fetch the expensive half when somebody actually opens the row.
 *
 * Worth saying plainly, because it is easy to assume otherwise: withholding the prompt from peers
 * is **not** a confidentiality measure. In a call the prompt is built from the transcript every
 * participant already holds. It is withheld because it is bulky and ephemeral, which means a host
 * may reasonably choose to share it — see `detail` on {@link InterpretationPort.observe}.
 */

/**
 * How far a pass has got, in terms a UI can render without knowing which backend produced it.
 *
 * Seven phases rather than AD4M's thirteen steps, and the collapsing is deliberate: a person
 * watching a bar wants to know whether to keep waiting, and `backedOff` / `notCandidate` /
 * `awaitingAuthor` are three ways of saying "not on this machine, nothing to watch here". A
 * backend with fewer states than this reports the ones it has; a backend with more maps them in.
