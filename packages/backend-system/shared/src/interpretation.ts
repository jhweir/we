/**
 * Turning what was said into typed records — as a capability, not a model to administer.
 *
 * `RuntimeAdminPort` already knows about LLMs: it lists them, adds them, downloads them and picks a
 * default. What it cannot do is *use* one against a dataset's own schema. That is the same gap
 * {@link TranscriptionPort} was created to close for speech, and it has the same consequence — the
 * transcribe module cannot reach interpretation without importing `@coasys/ad4m` directly and
 * declaring `backends: ['ad4m']`, which is the coupling the module contract exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## Why the caller supplies the turns
 *
 * The obvious shape — `interpret(dataset)` — would have the backend find the text itself. It is
 * wrong for the same reason `TranscriptionPort` does not own utterance segmentation: only the
 * caller knows what it is pointing at. A transcript is a call's children; a channel is a query; a
 * document is a subtree. Encoding any one of those here would make the port mean "interpret the
 * thing the transcribe module happens to write", and the second caller would need a second method.
 *
 * The backend can also gather its own turns on a standing watch — see {@link InterpretationPort.watch}
 * — but that is a different operation with different failure modes, not this one with a default.
 *
 * ## Why `classes` is required
 *
 * The class list is the real control surface, and making it optional would invite the one call
 * nobody should make. Every selected class puts its **whole shape** into the prompt — every
 * property, hinted or not — so cost and quality both degrade with the size of the list, and a class
 * carrying layout fields (a text block's `style`, `level`, `marks`) offers the
 * model a dozen fields it should never fill. "Interpret against everything installed" is not a
 * convenient default; it is the failure mode.
 *
 * ## Proposals, not writes
 *
 * A backend that supports provenance may stage the model's output rather than committing it, when a
 * value already has a human author. Those staged values surface through {@link InterpretationPort.proposals}
 * and are resolved with {@link InterpretationPort.accept} / {@link InterpretationPort.reject}. A
 * backend without that gate returns an empty proposal list and writes directly — callers must treat
 * an empty list as "nothing pending", never as "not supported", because the two are indistinguishable
 * and only one of them is worth telling a user about.

   *   per-subscriber one, so a host that wants it available on demand enables it when the watch is
   *   created and decides here whether to forward it. That is a cost worth paying once: it is
