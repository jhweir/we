/**
 * The neutral model contract — what "a model" means, independent of any backend.
 *
 * The query IR in this package has always been neutral at runtime (`queryEngine.ts` is the proof:
 * the inmemory backend runs the whole application on it). This file is its **type-level
 * companion**: the instance base every record satisfies, the static surface every entity class
 * presents, and the typed-query generics that make `findAll(p, { include: { $likeCount: … } })`
 * return rows whose `$likeCount` is a `number` — for every backend, keyed off the neutral
 * interfaces `@we/entities` generates from its manifest rather than off any one backend's
 * decorator metadata.
 *
 * The generics deliberately mirror the AD4M ORM's typed-query machinery, which is fully
 * structural — the shapes were proven there, and keeping them recognisable is what makes the AD4M
 * classes satisfy this contract without adaptation. Where this contract is *looser* (dataset
 * handles are `unknown`, write values tolerate backend-specific representations), that is the
 * neutrality: those are exactly the points where backends legitimately differ.

 * repo's to choose: AD4M's executor writes this exact string, so what is written here is a *record*
 * of somebody else's wire format, and any backend answering a polymorphic read has to match it. The
 * failure mode if one does not is quiet — records arrive with no type and every consumer falls back
 * to whatever it does for an unknown row, which looks the same as a relation that hydrated nothing.
