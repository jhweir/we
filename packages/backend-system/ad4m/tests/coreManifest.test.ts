/**
 * The core vocabulary: authored manifest vs generated classes.
 *
 * `CORE_MANIFEST` is the source of truth and the decorated classes are generated from it. This
 * holds the two in agreement through a *different* compiler: every entity compiled from the
 * manifest at runtime must produce the same schema the generated class does — same predicates,
 * same cardinalities, same storage and read behaviour, same type marker. A codegen bug and a
 * compiler bug cannot both make the same mistake silently, and a wrong predicate would not error
 * anywhere — it would silently write data where nothing looks for it — which is why the comparison
 * is exhaustive rather than a spot check.
