/**
 * Where something sits, on one canvas.
 *
 * A position is a fact about a **pair** — this view, this node — and not about either one alone.
 * Every design that stores it on one side loses information the moment the other side multiplies:
 * `x`/`y` on a block means a record can be on one canvas only, and the same note pinned to two
 * canvases in two places is the ordinary case rather than the exotic one. So the coordinate lives on
 * the relation, which is what this is.
 *
 * ## Why many small records rather than a map on the canvas
 *
 * A canvas holding `{ nodeId: {x, y} }` in one field is a read-modify-write, and a shared canvas is
 * the worst possible place for one: two people dragging two *different* cards would clobber each
 * other, and the loser would watch their card snap back with no explanation. `MutedAgent` made the
 * same call for the same reason — one record per fact, so two independent changes are two
 * independent writes. Two people dragging the *same* card is a real conflict and last-write-wins is
 * the right answer to it; two people dragging different cards is not a conflict at all and must not
 * be turned into one.
 *
 * ## Why `Ad4mModel` and not `WeNode` — the contrast with `Relationship`
 *
 * A relationship is a **claim**: arguable, ratable, authored as a statement, which is exactly why
 * being a `WeNode` is the whole point of it. A placement is **bookkeeping about a view**. Nobody
 * wants to argue with a coordinate, and somebody who wants to comment on a sticky note comments on
 * the note, which is already a `WeNode`. Making these commentable would double the storage per card
 * to enable a thread nobody will open.
 *
 * It is still authored, because every expression is — which is what makes "everybody shares one
 * arrangement" and "everybody keeps their own" a difference of one `where` clause rather than a
 * migration. Shared is the default, since a canvas is a shared artifact; per-agent stays free.
 *
 * ## What it does not decide
 *
 * A canvas is the container today. It should not be the container forever: the general thing is a
 * *saved view*, and a canvas is its degenerate case — one where every node happens to be placed and
 * the layout is `manual`. The evidence is already in the engine, where pinning a node on a knowledge
 * map holds it exactly until the page reloads. When that becomes durable it wants this record and a
 * different thing on the other end of the parent link, which costs a query rather than a model.
