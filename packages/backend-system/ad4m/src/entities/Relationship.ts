/**
 * A connection somebody drew between two things, in their own words.
 *
 * Every edge WE could previously draw came from a schema: a relation declared on a model, followed
 * forwards or backwards. That is the right way to render structure somebody already committed to,
 * and it cannot express the thing a knowledge map is actually for — noticing that *this* contradicts
 * *that*, that a task came out of a call, that two people's notes are about the same idea. Those are
 * claims made after the fact, by a person, about a pair of records nobody anticipated relating.
 *
 * ## Why an entity rather than a link
 *
 * The connection has to be able to carry things. A `WeNode` gets comments, signals, mentions and an
 * author for free, and all four are the point:
 *
 * - **Comments**, because a claim that two things are related is exactly the kind of claim people
 *   argue about, and the argument belongs on the claim rather than on either end of it.
 * - **Signals**, because "how strongly?" is a community judgement rather than a number the person
 *   who drew the line gets to set. A `SignalType` already carries mode, range and aggregate, and is
 *   per-agent, so a weight becomes something a space computes rather than something one member
 *   asserts. That is why there is no `weight` property here: a scalar would be one agent's opinion
 *   wearing the clothes of a fact.
 * - **Author and provenance**, because who said two things are connected is most of what the
 *   statement is worth.
 *
 * ## Why the endpoints are untyped, and carry their type beside them
 *
 * A relation declared in a schema names its target class. This one cannot: the whole point is to
 * connect a `TaskBlock` to a community's own `Sighting` to a `CollectionBlock`, and any pair a
 * member finds worth connecting. `CollectionBlock.children` is already untyped for the same reason,
 * so the shape is not new.
 *
 * What is new is `sourceType`/`targetType`. A graph node's address is minted from its dataset, its
 * type and its id, so drawing this as an edge needs both ends' types — and an untyped relation
 * cannot supply them. Storing the names beside the ids means an edge can be drawn from the
 * relationship record alone, with no round trip to ask each end what it is. The cost is two strings
 * that could drift from reality if a record were ever retyped, which is not a thing that happens:
 * an id belongs to one record and a record does not change class.

   * What makes two mentions the same connection — the pair and the label, joined.

   * The dedup key, and composite for the same reason {@link EventBlock.occurrence} is: a class
   * gets exactly one identity property, and no single field identifies a connection. The label
   * alone collapses every "contradicts" in a space into one record; either end alone is wrong by
   * construction, since the whole point is that a record has many connections.
   *
   * Written by the model rather than derived, because machine-authored instances go through
   * `create_subject` server-side and never pass WE's own write path — the hint spells the format.
   * Denormalised and never recomputed: relabel the connection and the next pass sees a different
   * one and writes a new record. That is the accepted cost of a single-property key, and it fails
   * in the safe direction — a duplicate somebody deletes, rather than two distinct claims merged.
   *
   * Not `required`, deliberately, and for the reason `occurrence` records: required would mean
   * every connection drawn by hand on a board carries `uninitialized`, and two of them would then
   * dedup into each other. Left unset, an instance is invisible to dedup — the right answer for a
   * record no machine is managing.
