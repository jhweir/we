   * What this collection *is* — `'call'`, `'notes'`, later `'board'`. Semantic, and deliberately
   * separate from `type`.
   *
   * `type` is the **structural node type** (`root` for a composition, `collection` for a nested
   * one), which the serializer round-trips. It has been doing double duty as a discriminator — `type: 'root'`
   * currently means "is a post" — and overloading it further would put semantic values into a
   * structural field, which is the mistake the transcribe module made writing `tag: 'transcript'`
   * into `TextBlock.style` (a field that means `h1`/`blockquote`).
   *
   * A scalar rather than a tag relation because this is the field you *query by*:
   * `where: { kind: 'call' }` is a native `eq` that pushes down and composes with `order`/`limit`,
   * whereas tag membership would need a reverse traversal WE does not wire up. Tags remain for user
   * taxonomy — what a thing is *about*, not what surface owns it.
   *
   * Never written into `editorState`: the blob is a projection of the children, and `kind` is a
   * fact about the collection, not its content.
   *
   * Posts predate this field and are still identified by `type: 'root'`; the composer now also writes
   * `kind: 'post'` so new posts carry both, and the read side can switch once the legacy set stops
   * mattering. **A `CollectionBlock` with `type: 'root'` and no `kind` is a post.**

  /**
   * Who owns this collection's children — `'document'` (one agent authored the whole artifact) or
   * `'feed'` (many agents append independently). See `CollectionMode` in `@we/block-shared`.
   *
   * The companion to `kind`, and the division of labour between them is the point: **`kind` is a
   * free label** saying what the collection is *for*, invented by whichever template needs it and
   * registered nowhere; `mode` is the one fact a consumer must know, because it is the one that
   * changes what code may do to the record. `reconcileBlocks` reads it and refuses anything not
   * `'document'` — running it on a feed deletes every child the editing agent's tree omits, which
   * is everyone else's.
   *
   * A property rather than a lookup from `kind`, and that is a peer-to-peer decision rather than a
   * modelling preference. A kind→mode registry answers differently depending on which modules the
   * *reading* client installed, so of two agents in one channel the one missing the module is
   * unprotected. Written here, the fact travels with the record and a client that has never heard
   * of the label still knows what it must not do.
   *
   * Denormalised — every channel repeats `'feed'` — which is the accepted cost of not requiring a
   * schema authority the space may never have shared with you. It is also the degenerate,
   * correctly-degrading form of shapes-in-the-space (content-models-plan stage F).
   *
   * Unset means legacy: collections written before this field existed. Treated as reconcilable,
   * since every pre-existing post is one and refusing them would break editing everywhere.

  /**
   * What this collection is called, and what it is about — set by whoever owns it, not derived.
   *
   * On the shared model rather than per kind because they are the two pieces of metadata *every*
   * collection can have: a call, a notes collection, a board. Kind-specific state (a board's column
   * config, say) does not belong here and should not accumulate as more scalars — that is what a
   * per-kind model or a JSON bag is for.
   *
   * Scalars for the same reason `kind` is one: these are fields you query by. `where: { title:
   * { contains: … } }` pushes down to the backend and composes with `order` and `limit`, and a list
   * can sort by title. Held in `editorState` or a blob they would be invisible to all of that — and
   * a call has no `editorState` at all, since the transcribe module creates it rather than the
   * composer.
   *
   * Distinct from `textContent`, which is derived from the children for search and preview: a title
   * written there would be overwritten by the next reconcile.
   *
   * Unset costs nothing — an AD4M property is a link that exists only once written — so collections
   * that never get named carry no storage, and no migration was needed to add these.
