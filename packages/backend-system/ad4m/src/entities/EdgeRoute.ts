/**
 * How a connection is *drawn*, on one board.
 *
 * {@link Placement} is the same record for a card: where a node sits is a fact about a **pair** —
 * this view, this node — rather than about either alone. A connection's shape is the same kind of
 * fact. The same `Relationship` can appear on two boards, and the route that keeps it clear of the
 * cards on one says nothing about the other, so the route lives on the pair.
 *
 * Which is also why it is not on `Relationship` itself. A relationship is a **claim** — arguable,
 * ratable, authored as a statement. Where its line leaves a card is not part of the claim, and
 * storing it there would make one board's tidying follow the connection everywhere it is shown.
 *
 * ## Why `Ad4mModel` rather than `WeNode`
 *
 * Bookkeeping about a view, exactly as a placement is. Nobody wants to comment on a bend; somebody
 * who wants to argue with the connection argues with the `Relationship`, which is already a
 * `WeNode`. See `Placement` for the longer form of the same reasoning.
 *
 * ## Anchors
 *
 * An anchor pins which **side** of a card the line leaves or arrives on — `n`, `e`, `s`, `w`, or
 * empty for "work it out from where the two cards are", which is what every connection does until
 * somebody says otherwise.
 *
 * A side rather than a point along it, on purpose: a side survives the card being resized, matches
 * the four handles a card already offers, and is a fraction of the fiddliness. "40% along the top"
 * is more expressive and nobody has wanted it.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* set by which handle a connection was dragged out of. Today you grab whichever
 * of the four dots is nearest and the edge still routes sensibly; pinning that silently would give
 * people connectors leaving the top of a card and looping around, having done nothing but pick the
 * closest handle. Anchoring is an explicit act — drag the end of an existing line around the card's
 * rim — and the handles stay hints.
