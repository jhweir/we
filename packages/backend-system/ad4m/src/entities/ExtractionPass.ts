/**
 * That a call was read by a model, and how it went.
 *
 * ## Why the records are not enough
 *
 * An extraction pass produces records, and those are real, stored and queryable — so what a call
 * yielded survives on its own. What did not survive was everything about the *reading*: whether it
 * happened at all, when, who spent the tokens, and whether it failed. `interpretationStore` reports
 * all of that beautifully and reports it from a live subscription that starts empty and is thrown
 * away on every space change, so the moment you reload — or walk to another space and back — a call
 * that was read an hour ago is indistinguishable from one that never was, and a pass that *failed*
 * is indistinguishable from one that found nothing. Both of those are questions somebody asks about
 * a meeting they are reviewing, and the answer was gone.
 *
 * ## The prompt and the response are here, and they are the expensive part
 *
 * They were deliberately left out, and the reasons were good: a prompt is the whole transcript, so
 * one per pass in a shared neighbourhood means every member replicating a second copy of every
 * conversation, for a payload almost nobody opens. And `shareExtractionDetail` is off by default
 * precisely because the exchange is sensitive.
 *
 * They are written anyway, for now, because a log that omits what was actually asked cannot answer
 * the question people have while this is being built: not "did a pass run" but "why did it decide
 * *that*". Two things follow from the choice and are worth stating plainly rather than discovering:
 * every member of the space replicates every prompt, and `shareExtractionDetail` no longer governs
 * whether the exchange is shared, only whether the *live* readout offers it — which makes that
 * setting the first thing to revisit if this stays.
 *
 * The honest way back is not deletion: gate the write on the same setting, so a space that wants a
 * complete log says so, and one that does not keeps the promise its setting makes.
 *
 * ## Why it hangs off the call
 *
 * `CollectionBlock.extractionPasses`, so a panel showing one call reads its passes with the same
 * subject it reads everything else with. Before this, the readout had no call id to be scoped by at
 * all — the store's rows describe *every* pass this agent knows about — so a panel open on a past
 * call listed the live call's activity above that call's records and said nothing about the
 * mismatch.
 *
 * Its own relation rather than `children`, which holds a collection's *content*: a pass is a fact
 * about the collection, not something in it, and putting it in `children` would put it on the board.
