/**
 * `InterpretationPort` over AD4M's generic interpretation engine.
 *
 * Less thin than {@link createAd4mTranscriptionPort}, and the extra weight is all translation
 * between two vocabularies that genuinely differ. The executor speaks SHACL target-class URIs and
 * raw predicates; the port speaks WE's entity and property names, because a caller that had to know
 * `we://TaskBlock` and `we://due_date` would be coupled to the backend in everything but the import.
 *
 * ## What the executor does not do, and this does
 *
 * **Parenting.** `runInterpretation` writes instances via `create_subject` and returns their URIs;
 * it does not attach them to anything. A `TaskBlock` with no parent is a real, queryable record that
 * no WE route lists, because the routes reach content by traversal. So a `parent` in the request
 * becomes a link written here, after the pass. Failing to write it would produce the worst kind of
 * bug — a successful extraction that looks like nothing happened.
 *
 * **Naming.** Overlay values come back keyed by predicate. They are re-keyed to property names off
 * the perspective's own registered shapes, so a review UI can render "title: Ship the docs".
 * Predicates that map to nothing are dropped rather than shown raw: a reviewer cannot make a good
 * accept/reject decision about `we://x_7` and should not be asked to.

 * ## Why per model, when it used to be flat
 *
 * Reading a predicate back to a name is one-to-many, and only the class settles which. Predicates
 * are shared *on purpose* — `entities/CONVENTIONS.md` says to prefer generic reusable ones, because
 * that is what lets `?node we://title ?t` span every kind of block — so several models legitimately
 * name one predicate differently: `we://title` is `title` on eight models and `label` on
 * `EmbedBlock` and `Relationship`.
 *
 * A flat table has to pick one, and picked whichever registered first. `Relationship` is third in
 * `SPACE_MODELS`, so `we://title` resolved to `label` for **every proposal in the app** — a task's
 * title was printed under a relationship's field name, and the summary that leads with `title` then
 * matched nothing and fell through to raw map order. Neither symptom pointed at the cause.
 *
 * So the tables are built per model and indexed by the class the base actually belongs to.
 * {@link flat} remains for a base that could not be classified: it is exactly the old behaviour, and

    the flag was already true. Keyed by uuid, each perspective gets its own, and the map is also
    what lets `observe` hand out an unsubscribe without tearing down the parenting the watch relies
    on: subscribers come and go, the underlying AD4M listener does not.

    That last part is not a choice. `addAutoProcessorEventListener` returns nothing to unsubscribe
    with, so the one subscription per perspective has to be permanent and fan out in front of it.

        Create, or replace — never register over what is already there.

        `addAutoProcessor` is create-only, and the reason is not obvious from its name.
        `write_processor` overwrites a processor's scalars (its setters are `setSingleTarget`) but
        writes `interpretationClasses` through the shape's `addLink` setter, so registering twice
        under one processor id **unions** the two class lists rather than replacing them. Narrowing
        by re-registering therefore *widens*, permanently, for the whole neighbourhood — the class
        list is shared state and there is no subtraction.

        That was harmless while the list was a constant naming two core classes: every registration
        unioned a set with itself. It stops being harmless the moment the list can differ between
        one registration and the next, which is exactly what a space defining its own models does.

        So: read what is registered, and if the set differs, delete the config first. The
        `InterpretationRun` nodes survive a delete by design — they are the processed-turn cursor —
        so a processor re-registered under the same id resumes where it left off rather than
        re-reading the whole conversation. Right for narrowing; for widening it means the new class
        applies to what is said from here, and a one-shot press is how the rest of the transcript
        gets swept with it.

        Best-effort: a read that fails leaves `existing` empty and falls through to a plain

          `InterpretationRun` in the shared graph, where it syncs to every peer and stays there —

 * Turns to read, as a query over the graph rather than a list the host gathered.

 * work that way, because the whole point is that it runs with nobody there to read anything. So the
 * scope is a query, and this is where WE's layout gets written in SPARQL.
 *
 * That is uncomfortable — dialect in a string is exactly what the port exists to avoid — but it is
 * the adapter's own file, which is the one place backend vocabulary is allowed. The alternative is
 * a query IR that can express reification, which is a much larger thing to want for one call site.
 *
 * ## What the shape has to be
 *
 * `?speaker`, `?text` and `?timestamp` are all three required; a query binding only speaker and
 * text fails the gather. `?timestamp` is what makes a turn *identifiable* — the processed-turn
 * cursor uses it to tell a re-gathered turn from the same words said again later — so it is load
 * bearing rather than decoration.
 *
 * Author and timestamp come off the **reifier of the body link**, not from properties on the block.
 * That is AD4M's own convention (`ad4m://ontology/author`, `ad4m://ontology/timestamp`, keyed by
 * `rdf:reifies`), and it is why a WE `TextBlock` needs no author field for this to work: every
 * agent transcribes their own microphone, so the link's author *is* the speaker.

/**
 * Delete a processor's config, which is what stops it — and the seam an AD4M release closes.
 *
 * Deleting the config *is* the removal. `write_processor` puts an `AutoProcessorConfig` instance
 * into the perspective's own graph and the watch loop reads its processors back out of that graph
 * on every tick, so removing the record is what stops the loop seeing it. That also makes it the
 * right shape rather than a workaround: the config is shared with every peer, so this stops the
 * watch for the neighbourhood rather than only for whoever pressed stop — which is what a shared
 * watch has to mean.
 *
 * **`perspective.removeAutoProcessor(watchId)` replaces this whole body** once WE's pinned
 * `@coasys/ad4m` carries it. It landed in `coasys/ad4m` #931 and is on `dev`; the version pinned
 * here (`0.13.0-test-interpretation-2`) was published before it, so until a build is cut from
 * `dev` the links have to be removed by hand. Nothing else about the feature waits on that.
 *
 * ## Why the links, and not the ORM
 *
 * This used to call `AutoProcessorConfig.register(perspective)` first, because `findAll` resolves a
 * shape by name and the client model is named differently from the class the executor registers.
 * But `register` *writes SDNA*: it installs the TypeScript model's SHACL over the same target class
 * the executor hard-wires, replacing a definition the engine owns as a side effect of tidying up
 * after a call.
 *
 * The two shapes agree on property names and paths — there is a parity test for exactly that — and
 * that test compares nothing else. Setters, constructors and literal encoding are all free to
 * differ while it passes, and the write path is made of setters. So the class an executor wrote
 * through on one call could be a different class by the next one, with nothing in between reporting
 * a problem.
 *
 * Whether or not that is what bit us, a delete has no business redefining a class. The node URI is
 * derived from the processor id, so its links can be removed directly — no shape lookup, no
 * registration, nothing for the engine's own definition to collide with.
