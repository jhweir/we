/**
 * The AD4M query adapter — the {@link QueryAdapter} the renderer routes every `QueryIR` through.
 *
 * AD4M's `Ad4mModel.query`/`findAll` speak the flat `$query` dialect, so lowering a `QueryIR` to AD4M
 * is just the neutral `irToFlatQuery` (in `@we/schema-shared`). What's AD4M-*specific* — and lives
 * here, not in the agnostic renderer — is the capability profile (`ad4mCapabilities`) plus the two
 * conditional degradations that no capability boolean can express (see `plan` below). `planQuery`
 * uses the profile to route anything AD4M can't push down to the compute-up fallback (`executeQueryIR`)
 * instead of silently mis-executing it.
 *
 * What's native (verified against AD4M's `Where`/`Order` types and coasys/ad4m #867/#868):
 * - Scalar operators eq / not(→ne,nin) / lt / lte / gt / gte / contains, plus OR/AND/NOT combinators.
 * - `include` (nested), `count` projections, `parent` drill-down (`scope`).
 * - Sort by property, by a relation path, and by a projection count — but **one sort key only**
 *   (the SPARQL pagination pushdown is single-key), and only with a `limit`/`offset`.
 *
 * Deliberately routed to the compute-up fallback (not native):
 * - `startsWith`/`endsWith` operators, sum/min/max/avg aggregates, and — the confirmed gap —
 *   **filtering by a related model's property** (`{ rel, some/none }`): AD4M's `where` has no
 *   relation quantifier, so `relationFilters` is false.
 *
 * Two documented caveats aren't clean capability booleans, and aren't capability gaps at all — they
 * are **AD4M bugs**: an explicit OR/AND/NOT in `where` disables its sort/pagination pushdown, and a
 * projection / relation-path sort silently needs a `limit`. In both cases AD4M returns the correct
 * rows and simply ignores the ordering, so they are reported as `degraded` (run + warn), not
 * `compute-up` (which would fail loud until something computed them up) — see {@link Disposition}.
 * The real fix is upstream in AD4M; when it lands, grep `sort:under-boolean` / `sort:needs-limit`
 * and delete these two blocks.

/**
 * The executor build this profile was established against.
 *
 * Every line below — and both degradations in `plan` — is a **claim about somebody else's
 * software**, checked by nothing at build time. `planQuery` is exact about what WE will do with the
 * answers, and completely credulous about the answers themselves: if a release changes AD4M's sort
 * pushdown, nothing here fails. Skew shows up as *wrong rows in the right shape* — a feed silently
 * in the wrong order, a "top posts" list that is not — which is the failure mode with no error
 * channel at all.
 *
 * There is no handshake to close that gap with: the executor exposes no query-capability report to
 * ask. So the version is recorded instead, next to the claims it belongs to, and the two rules are:
 *
 * - When the `@coasys/ad4m` pin in the root `package.json` moves, re-check this and move this
 *   constant with it — the pin moving and this staying put is exactly the silent case.
 * - Verify by running the query, not by reading the changelog. `packages/backend-system/ad4m/tests`
 *   pins what the *planner* says; only an executor answers what the executor does.
 *
 * The pin itself is currently a test tag rather than a release, which is worth knowing when reading
 * "verified": what was verified was that build.
 *
 * This one was hand-published from `dev` at **54a3fd956** — the merge of coasys/ad4m#927, which
 * completes the eight-PR model-layer series — under npm's `dev` tag rather than `latest`. The SHA
 * matters more here than usual: a hand-published version corresponds to no git tag, so it is the
 * only thing tying this string to a build. And the executor binary is never published at all (WE
 * runs the one at `ad4m/target/release/`, per `seed-runtime.json`), so the Rust half — which is
 * where five of those eight PRs live — is pinned by that SHA and by nothing else. A core built
 * from this commit against an executor built from another is exactly the skew this constant exists
 * to make visible, and npm cannot catch it.
