/**
 * Entities over plain rows — the in-memory half of what a declared manifest means.
 *
 * The AD4M adapter compiles a manifest into decorated model classes that write triples against
 * minted predicates. This compiles the *same manifest* into classes that write objects into
 * arrays, and the difference is invisible to a caller: `Space.findAll(dataset, { where, include })`,
 * `space.save()`, `settings.addInstalledTemplates(t)` all mean what they always meant.
 *
 * That equivalence is the point. Stores and the boot sequence can then be tested against real
 * entity behaviour instead of hand-written fakes — and a fake is exactly what stops being true
 * first, since nothing forces it to keep matching the thing it stands in for.
 *
 * Reads run through the shared query engine (`compileQuery` → `QueryIR` → `executeQueryIR`), so
 * filtering, ordering, paging, relation hydration and count projections are the engine's semantics
 * rather than a second implementation of them.
