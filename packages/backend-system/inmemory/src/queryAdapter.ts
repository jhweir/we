// so its adapter lowers with the neutral `irToFlatQuery`. Capabilities mirror what that flat lowering
// expresses — relation filters and non-count aggregates stay gaps (irToFlatQuery throws on them),
// which the renderer then falls back on. This is a real, AD4M-free QueryAdapter — it exercises the
// same renderer path the AD4M adapter does.
//
// `scope` is the exception, and is handled rather than declined: the shared engine has always been
// able to execute a drill-down (`scopeRows`), and only the *lowering* could not express one, because
// `irToFlatQuery` refuses a `scope` it cannot resolve to a backend predicate. This dialect needs no
// resolution — the re-compile on the other side carries `scope` straight back into the IR — so it is
// carried across the flat form instead of being lost. Declaring it unsupported cost the showcase
// templates every drill-down they have: a channel's messages, a board column's cards.
