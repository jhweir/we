/**
 * The ports bundle as a conformance surface.
 *
 * `backendPorts.ts` says the boot suite "doubles as the conformance test", but
 * until now the in-memory bundle stubbed its data plane (`ephemeral: () =>
 * null`, two bindings) — so a suite running against it could exercise
 * lifecycle and nothing else, while the AD4M adapter shipped a full
 * $getEntity/$queryAdapter/mutations/$identities surface nothing compared
 * against. These tests pin the bundle to the full binding surface and run a
 * create → query → update → delete round-trip plus the ephemeral bus through
 * it — the contract exercised end to end with no executor.
