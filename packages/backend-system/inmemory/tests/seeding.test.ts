/**
 * Seeded peers — other agents' profiles, and other agents being present.
 *
 * Both exist for the same reason: this backend runs one agent, so anything rendering *people*
 * degenerates to a column of one. A feed with a single author and a presence roster containing only
 * yourself both render correctly and show nothing about whether the design holds up, which makes
 * them useless as the subject of a screenshot.
 *
 * The two halves are genuinely different seams. A profile is a *read* the directory serves, and it
 * cannot be published because `publish` writes only `ctx.selfId()` — as the real directory does.
 * Presence is a *message*, so it has to arrive over the bus the way a heartbeat would, and keep
 * arriving, because presence ages itself out on a TTL by design.
