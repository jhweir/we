 * Drop where-conditions whose operands did not resolve.
 *
 * A reactive reference in a where clause — `url: { not: { $store:
 * 'datasetStore.currentDatasetCid' } }` — legitimately resolves to `undefined`
 * for a frame (boot, dataset switch) or permanently (a store the host doesn't
 * carry). Serialized, `{ not: undefined }` becomes the empty condition `{}`,
 * which a backend's parser rightly refuses ("data did not match any variant of
 * untagged enum WhereCondition"). An unresolved input means "don't filter on
 * this yet", not "send a filter with a hole in it" — the effect re-runs and
 * applies the real filter once the value exists.
 *
 * **Only `undefined` is unresolved.** An empty string is a value, and it stays — which is not what
 * {@link scopeIsAnchored} does one field along, and the asymmetry is deliberate. Widening a scope is
 * what an unanchored view wants; widening an *identity* is never what anybody wants, so a template
 * asking about a record it has no id for must be gated rather than quietly answered with whichever
 * record the backend happened to return first.
 *
 * Returns the pruned clause, or `undefined` when nothing survives.

/**
 * Whether a resolved `scope` still names an anchor.
 *
 * The counterpart to {@link pruneUnresolvedWhere}, and the same rule one field along: an operand
 * that has not resolved means "do not narrow by this", never "narrow by nothing". The difference is
 * which way the failure falls, and it is the whole reason this exists — a `where` with a hole in it
 * is rejected by the backend and is therefore loud, whereas a scope whose `anchorId` is `undefined`
 * is a perfectly valid query for the children of no record, which returns nothing at all. Silently.
 *
 * That distinction is what lets a view carry an anchor unconditionally. A shipped view reads its
 * anchor from a URL parameter that is usually absent — `{ $: 'routeStore.params.anchor' }` — and
 * absent has to mean *the whole space*, which is what an unanchored view has always shown. Without
 * this the view would need two copies of every query behind an `$if`, or would go blank the moment
 * nobody had named a container.
 *
 * A literal empty string counts as absent too: that is what a `$localState` field holding "nothing
 * chosen yet" resolves to, and a template should not have to know the difference.
