/**
 * A rail that widens when you point at it — the shape of WE's shell sidebar, as nodes.
 *
 * ## Why this is a fragment and not the widget it replaced
 *
 * `CollapsibleSidebar` (`@we/widgets`, now deleted) was a layer-5 widget whose entire job was
 * arrangement, and it was reached through an `items` array: data in, but not structure. That is the
 * distinction the project turns on. A prop is a customisation somebody predicted and shipped; a node
 * tree is every customisation, including the ones nobody thought of. Asked to put a second line
 * under a space's name, or a progress bar in a group header, or a section that is neither an item
 * nor a group, the widget's answer was "wait for a release" and the follow-up had no answer at all.
 *
 * Nothing in it needed code. Hover is two event handlers, the width is a transition, the group
 * collapse is a `reveal`, and the reorder is `we-sortable` — which is a primitive precisely because
 * pointer capture and drag geometry *are* code.
 *
 * ## Ambient scope
 *
 * `railShell` declares two fields that its contents read, rather than threading them down:
 *
 * | Field             | Type    | Written by                | Read by                       |
 * | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
 * | `expanded`        | boolean | `railShell` (hover)       | `railItem`, `railGroup`       |
 * | `collapsedGroups` | array   | `railGroup` (its header)  | `railGroup` (its items)       |
 *
 * So `railItem` and `railGroup` are only valid inside a `railShell`. That is the same contract
 * `cardShell` has with `displayMode`, and it fails the same way if broken: `$local` warns to the
 * console and resolves to undefined, so the rail renders and simply never opens.
 *
 * `collapsedGroups` holds ids rather than one boolean per group, which is what lets a template
 * generate its groups from a `$query` — see `$toggleLocalIn` in OPERATORS.md.
