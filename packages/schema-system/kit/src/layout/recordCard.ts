/**
 * A small square standing for one record — a post, a space, a person, an image.
 *
 * It is what follows the pointer during a drag, and what a grid of gathered things is made of. One
 * fragment for both, because they are the same claim: *this is that thing*, at a size where the
 * only honest content is a picture and a name.
 *
 * ## Why a fragment rather than a primitive
 *
 * Because it is arrangement. There is no measurement in it, no focus management, no browser API —
 * a box, a picture, two lines of text. The argument for a primitive was that `@we/drag` cannot
 * mount a fragment, which is true and beside the point: the package does not mount it, the **host**
 * does, through the renderer seam `setGhostRenderer` opens. That is the graph engine's arrangement
 * for card content, second occurrence, and it exists precisely so the thing being drawn can stay on
 * the data side of the line.
 *
 * Which matters here more than usual. What a record looks like is exactly the kind of thing a
 * community will want to change, and a fragment can be forked, themed and — once fragments are
 * distributable at all — shared. A primitive freezes it into whatever WE shipped.
 *
 * ## What it can draw, in order
 *
 * `thumbnail`, then `content`, then the icon. Each is what the *source* had in hand at the moment
 * of the drag: nothing here resolves anything, because a ghost has to exist on the frame the
 * gesture begins and a Pocket row may point into a dataset the reader has never joined.
 *
 * `content` is the interesting one — a real rendering of the composition, laid out at
 * `contentWidth` and scaled down into the tile, which is how a post shows its own picture without
 * anybody denormalising one onto it. Text at this size is texture rather than words, which is the
 * same conclusion the graph's `contentMinZoom` reached about card content on a zoomed-out board.
