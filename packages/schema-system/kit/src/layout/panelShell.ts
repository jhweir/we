 * definition, two languages — which is the difference between a shared recipe and a coincidence.
 * Before it existed there were three spellings of the letter-spacing alone (`'wide'`, `"widest"`
 * and a raw `"0.06em"`), and four of the whole header.
 *
 * `variant: 'label'` carries the size and weight; the caps and the tracking are what make it read
 * as a name for the region rather than as a heading inside it. Muted rather than full-strength on
 * purpose: the panel's *content* is the thing being read, and a title competing with it is a title
 * that has misunderstood the job.
