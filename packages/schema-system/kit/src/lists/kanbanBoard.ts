/**
 * A board of columns of cards — coordination software from the same substrate as the social ones.
 *
 * Board and column are both `CollectionBlock`s (`kind: 'board'`, `kind: 'column'`, both feed-mode);
 * a card is whatever block the caller renders, held in a column's `children`. Moving a card between
 * columns is a relink, not an edit.
 *
 * ## Containment expresses status
 *
 * `TaskBlock` has a `status` field, and a board has columns. Those are two ways to say the same
 * thing, and this fragment picks containment: a card's column *is* its status. That is the more
 * general answer — a board can have any columns a community invents, where `status` is a fixed
 * vocabulary — and it means the card and the board cannot disagree, which two sources of truth for
 * one fact eventually do.
 *
 * The consequence, stated so it is a decision rather than an oversight: `TaskBlock.status` is
 * redundant inside a board and this fragment neither reads nor writes it. A template mixing the two
 * — a status dropdown *and* columns — will produce exactly the disagreement described above.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 *
 * Cards are ordered by `createdAt`, and there is no drag-to-reorder. The conflict-free ordering this
 * was waiting for has landed — a relation can be declared `ordered`, and two people rearranging it
 * converge — but it attaches to a *relation's membership*, and a column here reads its cards through
 * a `scope`, which lowers to a filter by parent link and has no membership to order. A surface that
 * wants an arrangement reads the column itself and hydrates its `children`, which come back in the
 * order somebody put them in.
 *
 * Not done here, because this is the portable tier and the caller supplies both the cards and what a
 * move means. A `position` scalar remains the wrong answer either way: two people reordering one
 * column write the same numbers and one of them loses. Moving a card *between* columns works today,
 * because that is a relink rather than an ordering.
