 * themes — written out four times in one file, and they had already drifted: only some of them
 * marked the space default, and the selected-row background was spelled two ways.
 *
 * The label is a `bare` button rather than a `Row` with an `onClick`, so choosing a row keeps
 * keyboard activation and a real button role, and the per-row actions can be real buttons beside it
 * rather than click handlers nested inside another click handler.
 *
 * Actions are always visible rather than revealed on hover. A hover affordance in a list this
 * narrow is invisible on a touchscreen and undiscoverable everywhere else; low-contrast icons cost
 * less than a control nobody finds.
