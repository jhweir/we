/**
 * The tier is a package boundary now, so it is checked against the package rather than the fixtures.
 *
 * The walk below tests *expansions*, which only covers fragments a fixture exists for — and when the
 * portable tier moved to `@we/schema-kit`, four collection fragments went with it that filter on
 * `spaceStore.mutedDids`, because none of them had one. They were store-namers sitting in the package
 * whose whole claim is that it names none, and nothing failed.
 *
 * Reading the source catches what no fixture set can promise to. Comments are stripped first: half
 * these files discuss `$store` in prose, and a test that cannot tell an explanation from a dependency
 * would be answered by rewording rather than by moving the fragment.

    What a store reference actually looks like now.

    The checks below it are `/\$store\s*:/` — a token #169 deleted — and `'$agent'`, so between them
    they matched nothing a fragment would write today and this walk passed for everything. Live
    evidence: `lists/kanbanBoard.ts` (since retired) hard-coded `$action: 'spaceStore.moveChild'` inside the package
    whose one promise is that it names no store, in the file the README points at as the example,
    and the guard was green.

    Two spellings reach a store now: an expression whose reference starts at one
    (`{ $: 'spaceStore.x' }`) and an action naming one (`$action: 'spaceStore.y'`). Matched against
    the `…Store.` *shape* rather than a list of names, so a store added later is covered without
    this file being told about it.

    `modules.<id>.…` is deliberately not matched: a module namespace is optional by construction and
    resolves to nothing when the module is absent, which is degradation this tier is allowed.
