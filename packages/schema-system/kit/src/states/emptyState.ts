 * ## Why this is a fragment and not a component
 *
 * Nothing here needs code — it is a centred Column, an icon and a line of text. Kept as data, an
 * author who wants a smaller icon edits one node; as a component they would need an `iconSize` prop
 * to have been predicted, implemented and released first. See CONVENTIONS.md for the full rule.
 *
 * ## Why a helper rather than a node per list
 *
 * Five of the cards route's fourteen lists had one of these and the other nine had nothing, so
 * switching content type either explained the emptiness or left the page blank depending on which
 * type you picked. The difference was not a decision — it was that each one had been written by
 * hand, and writing it fourteen times is what made it easy to skip.
 *
 * Sized and centred rather than a bare line of text, because it stands in for a grid of cards: a
 * left-aligned sentence under a header reads as a caption for content that is about to appear.
