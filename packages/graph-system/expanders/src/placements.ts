/**
 * Where does this node sit — answered from a *list*, never from a `find`.
 *
 * A board reads placements and asks each node where it goes. The obvious spelling of that question
 * is `placements.find(p => p.node === id)`, and it is the spelling that has to be unpicked the first
 * time a node has more than one placement on the same board. That day is already visible: freeform
 * placement is not responsive, and the mature conventions for making it responsive either scale one
 * coordinate set or store *several* — one per breakpoint. Every other way of adapting a placed
 * layout is a render-time choice over the same stored numbers; per-breakpoint placement is the one
 * that changes what is stored.
 *
 * Nothing writes a `tier` today, and nothing here asks anybody to. What this module buys is that the
 * code asking the question is already shaped to answer it from a list, so adding the field later is
 * a field rather than a refactor of every board query. Ten lines now against a migration later.
 *
 * ## The resolution rule
 *
 * "The most specific placement at or below the current tier", degrading exactly the way an absent
 * `mode` does in `modes.ts`:
 *
 * - a placement with **no tier applies everywhere**, and is what every placement written before this
 *   existed is;
 * - a placement naming a tier applies from that width **up**, so `md` still applies at `lg` — the
 *   same min-width cascade `mdUpProps` has, because it is the same ladder;
 * - the most specific applicable one wins, and equally specific rows are last-write-wins, which is
 *   the same answer two people dragging the same card get.
 *
 * A caller that does not know the width passes no tier and gets the tierless placement. That is the
 * honest answer rather than a guess: a seed runs in the data layer and cannot see the box its nodes
 * will be drawn in, so picking a tier-keyed row there would be picking one at random.
 */

/**
 * The breakpoint ladder, narrowest first.
 *
 * Spelled out rather than imported from `@we/tokens`: the graph engine has no dependency on the
 * design system and should not grow one to read four strings. It is the same ladder — if it ever
 * stops being, the mismatch is a placement resolving at the wrong width, so keep them in step.
