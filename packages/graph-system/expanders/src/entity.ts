/**
 * The entity expander — typed relations, in both directions.
 *
 * The default answer to "what is adjacent to this?" for anything backed by a model, and the one that
 * makes a knowledge map over interpretation output work without a line of per-class code: it reads
 * the dataset's own shapes, so a class installed last week appears with its relations already
 * traversable.
 *
 * ## Both directions, and why the reverse one matters
 *
 * WE's relations are one-directional — the neutral manifest does not emit `reverseOf`, and the IR
 * walks forward — so "what points at this?" has to be asked as its own query, against every shape
 * whose relations target this type. That is more work than following a relation, and it is not
 * optional: a map you can only walk downstream is a tree, and the interesting question about a belief
 * is usually who holds it, not what it mentions.

    Which relations could be pointing at this node.

    A declared target is the ordinary answer: a relation that names our type might hold us, and one
    that names another type cannot. An **untyped** relation could hold anything, so it is always a
    candidate — but only where the class is reified, and that restriction is doing real work.

    Reification is a declaration: the template has said this class *is* an edge and named the two
    relations that are its ends. Following those backwards is the only way a drawn connection is
    ever found, since the whole point is that it can join any two records and so declares no target.

    An untyped relation on an ordinary class carries no such statement. `CollectionBlock.children`
    is untyped for its own reasons, and treating it as a candidate here would make every node in
    the graph run a reverse scan for every container in the space — for an answer the `collection`
    expander already gives, in the direction it was built for.
