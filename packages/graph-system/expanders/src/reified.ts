/**
 * Reified edges — relationships that are entities in their own right.
 *
 * Some relationships carry data. AD4M's interpretation work produces exactly this shape: a
 * `SemanticRelationship { relevance }` whose two relations name the things it connects, so the edge
 * has properties, provenance and an identity of its own. Flux's existing schema has the same thing.
 *
 * Drawn naively they are a disaster: every relationship becomes a **node**, so a map of a hundred
 * tagged messages shows three hundred dots and no relationships at all. The fix is to recognise them
 * and collapse each instance into the single edge it stands for, carrying its scalars in `data` and
 * its address in `reifiedAs` — so clicking the edge can still open the underlying record.
 *
 * ## Why this is configuration rather than inference
 *
 * It is tempting to auto-detect: "a class with exactly two relations and no other purpose is an
 * edge". That is wrong often enough to be dangerous — a `Membership` with `agent` and `space` is a
 * reified edge, a `Comment` with `author` and `post` is a node people want to see and read. Only the
 * person modelling the space knows which is which, so the template says.

    An endpoint's type comes from the relation's declared target, or — where the relation is
    untyped — from a property on the row, or from what the endpoint itself says it is.

    The first two are not fallbacks for each other. A schema-declared relationship
    (`SemanticRelationship.tag` → `Topic`) knows its target class and stores no copy of it, which is
    right: the schema is the authority and a stored duplicate could drift from it. A drawn one has
    no declared target at all, so the row is the only place the type could live.

    The third rescues a case neither of the others can. `sourceType`/`targetType` are written by
    whoever creates the relationship, and not every writer does — an extraction pass can produce a
    `Relationship` without them, and every such edge was skipped as "missing an endpoint" though both
    ends existed and were perfectly readable. Now that these relations are read polymorphically the
    endpoint arrives already classified, so the type is in hand without the round trip the stored
    copy exists to avoid. Last rather than first: a writer that recorded the type meant it.
