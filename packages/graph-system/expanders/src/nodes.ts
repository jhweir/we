  `textContent` is last and was missing, which is why every composed card on a canvas read
  "CollectionBlock": a post has no `title` — the composer writes its text into `editorState` and a
  flattened copy into `textContent`, which exists "for search and preview" and is exactly a preview.
  With nothing matching, the label fell through to the entity name, so a wall of notes announced
  their class instead of their contents.
