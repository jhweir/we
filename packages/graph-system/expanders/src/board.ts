/**
 * The board seed — a container's contents, at the positions somebody put them.
 *
 * Every other seed answers "what is here". This one answers two questions, because a board holds
 * three facts that are usually one:
 *
 * - **Ownership** — containment. Where a record *lives*, and what a delete cascades to. A note born
 *   on a board is owned by it; a task from a call is owned by the call.
 * - **Membership** — the placement's existence. That it *appears* on this board. Many per record,
 *   one per board it is on.
 * - **Position** — the placement's coordinates.
 *
 * Letting containment carry both ownership and membership is what made "a note born here" and "a
 * task brought here" impossible to tell apart: putting an existing record on a board would have
 * reparented it, and a note the board owned could not be removed from view without deleting it.
 *
 * So placed records are fetched **by id**, from the placements. Containment is still read, but only
 * for what the board *owns* and nobody has positioned — the tray, which is a recovery surface rather
 * than a third kind of membership: a placement that failed to write, or a card composed before
 * anybody said where it goes.
 *
 * ## Why it is a seed rather than a layout
 *
 * The `manual` layout reads `x`/`y` off each node's own data and is right to: a layout arranges what
 * it is given and must not know how to fetch anything. So the merge happens here, where the data
 * layer is already in reach, and `manual` stays a dozen lines of arithmetic that works the same
 * whether the coordinates came from a placement, a fixture, or a field on the record.
 *
 * ## How it finds what to load without being told
 *
 * `contains` names the types a board may hold, and defaults to the block vocabulary — but a
 * community's own models are not in any list a template could have written. The placements supply
 * the rest: every one names the type of the thing it positions, so anything anybody has *placed* is
 * queried whether or not the template anticipated it. The two together are what let a board hold a
 * `Sighting` nobody had heard of when this file was written.
 *
 * Placements are read first for that reason, and their node references are read as bare URIs rather
 * than hydrated. An untyped relation has no target class for `include` to hydrate into, and the id
 * is what is wanted anyway: the records come back in one query per type — `where: { id: [...] }`,
 * which is native on AD4M and pushes down to a SPARQL `VALUES` clause — and are matched up here.
