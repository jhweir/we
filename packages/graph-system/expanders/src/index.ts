/**
 * `@we/graph-expanders` — WE's first-party answers to "what is adjacent to this?"
 *
 * Each is an independent implementation of {@link Expander} or {@link SeedSource} from
 * `@we/graph-protocol`; none knows about the others, and a module contributing its own does not need
 * to live in this package or in this repository. The engine resolves them through a registry the host
 * injects, so an external expander is a package exporting a factory.
 *
 * They divide by *how they find neighbours*, not by what the data means:
 * - {@link entityExpander} — typed relations, both directions, from the dataset's schema.
 * - {@link collectionExpander} — an untyped to-many relation, via the drill-down path.
 * - {@link propertyExpander} — the level below an entity: its own fields, and shared value nodes.
 * - {@link schemaExpander} — the level *above* an entity: a type node, opened into its instances.
 * - {@link querySeed} / {@link schemaSeed} / {@link datasetSeed} / {@link canvasSeed} — where a graph starts.
