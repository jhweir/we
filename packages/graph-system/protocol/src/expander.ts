/**
 * The expander contract — the graph system's primary extension point.
 *
 * "Show the whole perspective", "map these query results", "open this collection's children", "zoom a
 * model out into its properties", "explore spaces and neighbourhoods" are not five features. They are
 * one: a lazily-explored frontier, where each *kind* of node knows what is adjacent to it. An
 * expander answers that question for the kinds it claims, and the core does the rest — dedup,
 * expansion state, collapse, layout, rendering.
 *
 * A module adding a new source of nodes writes an expander and (optionally) a renderer. Nothing in
 * the core changes. That is the whole design.
 *
 * ## Why expansion is paged
 *
 * A hub node with four thousand neighbours must not be able to kill the frame on one click. The core
 * needs `total` back to offer "expanding adds 4,231 — top 50 / all", which is only possible if paging
 * is in the contract from the first version. Retrofitting it means every expander written before the
 * change is a lie about its own cost.
 *
 * ## Why this is not graph-specific
 *
 * `expand(id) -> neighbours` is what a tree view, a nested picker and a breadcrumb trail also want.
 * It lives here for now because there is one consumer; when a second appears it should move to a
 * package of its own rather than have that consumer depend on the graph.

   * is idempotent. The reasoning was sound and the premise was not: a host implements this over
   * whatever change notification its backend has, and a backend that reports "this query's answer
   * changed" cannot report anything about a query nobody asked. WE's does exactly that — its model
   * subscriptions fire only when the rows of *their own* query change — so a coarse watch was
   * subscribed to a one-row probe over the whole type, and a record created behind an existing one
   * left that probe's answer identical. The canvas that read it never heard, and stayed as loaded
   * while the panel beside it, subscribed to its own narrower query, updated.
   *
   * So a watch carries the read it came from, and a host subscribes to *that*. The cost the coarse
   * form was avoiding — one subscription per distinct read — is what makes the answer trustworthy,
   * and it is bounded by what the seeds actually asked for: a canvas makes four.
   *
   * Optional because it is a *capability*, not a requirement: a host with no change notification
   * (a fixture, a static export) simply omits it and the graph stays as loaded. Nothing calls this
   * directly — the engine derives what to watch from the reads its seeds performed.
