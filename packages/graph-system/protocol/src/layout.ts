/**
 * The layout contract.
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing and neither is obvious from the name.
 *
 * **Containment.** Expansion produces nesting — a collection holding children, a cluster holding its
 * members — so a layout may be asked to place children *inside* their parent's region. Simple layouts
 * ignore {@link LayoutInput.containment}; compound ones use it. It is in the contract from the start
 * because adding a hierarchy parameter once four layouts exist means rewriting four layouts.
 *
 * **Warm start.** Nodes arrive continuously: from expansion, and (once interpretation runs on a live
 * call) from the data layer while the user is looking at the map. A layout that re-runs from scratch
 * on every insert makes the graph jump every few seconds. So a layout receives the positions it
 * already produced and is expected to keep them roughly, moving new nodes into place around them.
