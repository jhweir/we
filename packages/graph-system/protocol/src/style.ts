 * is therefore data, and the match vocabulary is deliberately the one WE's schema system already uses
 * for `$filter` — `contains`, `exists`, `not`, `in` — so an author who can filter a list can style a
 * graph without learning a second dialect.
 *
 * Rules are evaluated in order and shallow-merged, last match winning per property. That makes
 * "everything is grey, beliefs are purple, *unresolved* beliefs are outlined" three rules that read
 * top to bottom, rather than one condition tree.
 *
 * Where a value genuinely has to be computed — size by centrality, colour by a scale — the answer is
 * not to grow this vocabulary toward a programming language. It is {@link MetricRef}: a named,
 * registered plugin, referenced from data with parameters. Same bargain the template system makes
