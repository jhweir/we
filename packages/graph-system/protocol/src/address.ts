/**
 * Node addressing — the one decision the rest of the graph system cannot recover from getting wrong.
 *
 * Every node the engine can hold needs a single stable identifier: an entity instance, one of its
 * properties, a literal value, a whole dataset, a synthetic cluster, a raw link target. They come
 * from different expanders that never meet, and they must still dedupe against each other, persist
 * positions against each other, and survive a graph that spans two datasets.
 *
 * So an address is a **string**, minted here and parsed here, and nowhere else. `@we/graph-core`
 * treats it as opaque — it compares addresses and reads {@link NodeAddress.kind}, never the rest.
 * That is what keeps the core free of any backend's notion of identity: the day a node comes from
 * NextGraph rather than AD4M, only the expander that mints it changes.
 *
 * ## Why a URI-shaped string rather than a struct
 *
 * A struct would be a nicer type and a worse key. Addresses are used as `Map` keys, `Set` members,
 * DOM ids, and persisted values on a board's nodes; every one of those wants a primitive. A struct
 * would mean a canonical-serialisation function that has to agree with itself everywhere, which is
 * the same string with extra steps and a new class of bug when two call sites serialise differently.
 *
 * ## Datasets in addresses
 *
 * `dataset` is present on entity-ish kinds because the holonic explorer expands *across* spaces, and
 * an address that assumed one dataset would make that a rewrite rather than a feature. It is the
 * dataset's **shared** id where there is one and the local id otherwise — see the note on
 * {@link entityAddress}.
 */

/**
 * What *sort of thing* a node is, structurally — as distinct from what it *means*
 * ({@link GraphNode.type}, which holds an entity class name, a property name, and so on).
 *
 * Renderers and style rules key on either. Keying only on the semantic type would leave property and
 * literal nodes unstyleable, since they have no entity class to name.
