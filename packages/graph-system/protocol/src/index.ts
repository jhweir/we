/**
 * `@we/graph-protocol` — the contracts the graph system is assembled from, and nothing else.
 *
 * Types only: this package erases entirely at build time, so depending on it costs a consumer no
 * runtime weight. It is the import for someone *writing a plugin* — an expander, a layout, a
 * renderer, a behaviour, a metric — which is a different job from placing a graph in a template, and
 * increasingly a third-party one.
 *
 * The pieces, and where to look:
 * - `address.ts` — how anything that can be a node is named. The load-bearing decision.
 * - `graph.ts` — nodes, edges, fragments.
 * - `expander.ts` — the primary extension point: what is adjacent to this node?
 * - `layout.ts` — positioning, with containment and warm-start in the contract.
 * - `style.ts` — declarative rules, and the metric escape hatch.
 * - `render.ts` — node renderers and interaction behaviours.
 * - `spec.ts` — the JSON a template writes.
