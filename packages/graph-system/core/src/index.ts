/**
 * `@we/graph-core` — the engine, with no framework and no backend in it.
 *
 * Two layers live here, and keeping them apart is deliberate:
 *
 * - **The scene** — {@link Viewport}, {@link SpatialIndex}, selection, positions. Everything needed to
 *   draw and interact with a set of placed nodes, knowing nothing about where they came from.
 * - **Exploration** — {@link GraphStore}, {@link ExpansionState}, {@link GraphEngine}. Expanders,
 *   expansion state, reference-counted collapse, bundling, budgets.
 *
 * A board built on this uses the scene and none of the exploration; a knowledge map uses both. That
 * is the split that stops a board dragging in expansion state it has no use for, and stops undo and
 * marquee selection leaking into an explorer that will never want them.
