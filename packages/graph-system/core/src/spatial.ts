/**
 * Spatial index and hit-testing — owned by the core, deliberately.
 *
 * With DOM nodes the browser will happily tell you what was clicked, and writing the drag, select and
 * connect behaviours against DOM events is the obvious thing to do. It is also the one-way door in
 * this system: a canvas renderer has no elements to hit, so every behaviour written that way has to
 * be rewritten to support dense mode. Behaviours here receive world coordinates and ask the core what
 * is there, so they never learn what a DOM node is and dense mode is additive.
 *
 * The index is a uniform grid rather than a quadtree. For this workload — points of broadly similar
 * size, rebuilt whenever the layout moves — a grid is faster to build, allocation-free to query, and
 * about thirty lines; a quadtree's advantage shows up with wildly non-uniform densities that a graph
 * layout does not produce.
