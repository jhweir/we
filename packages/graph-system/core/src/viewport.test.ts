/**
 * The camera, and the part of it something else is standing in front of.
 *
 * `setObscured` exists for one situation: a host that floats panels over the graph without shrinking
 * its box. The canvas is the full region and every pixel of it renders, so nothing about panning,
 * zooming or hit-testing changes — but "what can the reader see" stops being the same rectangle, and
 * a layout placing a node where nobody has placed one is asking exactly that question. The workshop
 * canvas asked it, got the whole region, and parked every freshly extracted card underneath the
 * transcript panel.
