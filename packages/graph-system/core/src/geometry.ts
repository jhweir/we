 * the pointer is elsewhere — had a visible stub leaving the middle of the card. Symmetric now, so an
 * edge is the segment *between* two shapes rather than between two centres.
 *
 * `attachPoint` works from either end unchanged: asked about `from` with the roles swapped, it gives

 * overrules the derived side, and for a shape with a tangent it overrules the direction of travel

 * card and immediately set off sideways, which reads as the anchor having been ignored.
 *
 * `step` is the exception and knowingly so: an anchor moves where it attaches, and its corners are
 * still derived from the axis the edge mostly runs along. Cross-axis anchors on an orthogonal route
 * want a router that solves the whole path, which is a different piece of work; the shape a board
