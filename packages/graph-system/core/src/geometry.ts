 * the pointer is elsewhere — had a visible stub leaving the middle of the card. Symmetric now, so an
 * edge is the segment *between* two shapes rather than between two centres.
 *
 * `attachPoint` works from either end unchanged: asked about `from` with the roles swapped, it gives
 * the point on the source facing the target. `horizontal` is not swapped with it — the axis is a
 * property of the edge, decided once from the centres.
 *
 * `anchors` pin which **side** of a node each end leaves or arrives on, where somebody has said. It
 * overrules the derived side, and for a shape with a tangent it overrules the direction of travel
 * too: an edge told to leave the north side departs *upwards*, or the curve would leave the top of a
 * card and immediately set off sideways, which reads as the anchor having been ignored.
 *
 * `step` is the exception and knowingly so: an anchor moves where it attaches, and its corners are
 * still derived from the axis the edge mostly runs along. Cross-axis anchors on an orthogonal route
 * want a router that solves the whole path, which is a different piece of work; the shape a canvas
 * uses is `smooth`.
 *
 * `waypoints` are points the route must pass through, in world coordinates — somebody's decision
 * about where this line goes, so they beat every derivation left. Each end attaches facing its
 * *nearest waypoint* rather than the far node, since that is the direction the line actually leaves
 * in, and `offset` is ignored: fanning is a way of separating two edges nobody has shaped, and an
