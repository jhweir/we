   * a jump at the one instant somebody is deciding whether the gesture did what they wanted.

   *
   * - **No target clearance.** The far end is a pointer, not a node, so there is no shape to stop
   *   short of. The near end takes the source's, which is what stops the line leaving the middle of
   *   the card it is being dragged out of.
   * - **No offset.** Bowing apart from a mutual pair is a question about two edges that both exist,
   *   and this one does not exist yet. That half of the old reasoning still stands.
   *
   * The style is resolved against a placeholder edge, so a rule with no `when` applies and one that
   * matches on a type or a property does not. That is the right answer either way: what a connection
   * with nothing said about it yet would be drawn as.
