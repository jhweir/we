/**
 * The graph's own chrome, as data.
 *
 * A control declares an icon, a title and what it does; the renderer draws every one of them the same
 * way. That is deliberate on two counts.
 *
 * It keeps them **framework-neutral** — a control is a plain object, so a module can contribute one
 * without shipping Solid code and without the second-runtime hazard that comes with it. And it keeps
 * them **consistent**: the first two modules to need an entry point each drew their own floating
 * button in a different corner, which is how the host-owned module rail came to exist. Controls are
 * the same lesson applied inside one component — the contributor knows what a control *means*, the
 * renderer knows where chrome goes and how it should look.
 *
 * The contract is narrow on purpose. A control nudges the view; it does not edit the graph. Anything
 * that needs to change data is a behaviour or an action on the host, not a button the engine draws.
