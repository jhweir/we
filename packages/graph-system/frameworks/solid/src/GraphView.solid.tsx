/**
 * The Solid adapter — a thin binding over `@we/graph-core`, and nothing else.
 *
 * The engine holds all the state and all the decisions; this file subscribes to it, converts "something
 * changed" into signals, and paints. That is the same seam the schema system uses (neutral semantics,
 * per-framework adapter), and it is why a React host would be a second file of this size rather than a
 * second implementation of the engine.
 *
 * ## What is drawn where
 *
 * Edge *lines* are SVG: a single retained-mode surface with sub-pixel curves, which SVG gives for
 * free. Everything else — nodes, node labels, edge labels — is DOM. Nodes want to be real elements,
 * since that is what lets a node hold a schema fragment, an avatar, eventually an editable block.
 *
 * Text is DOM without exception, and that is a scar rather than a preference: edge labels were SVG
 * `<text>` and jittered for seconds after a zoom, because the browser rasterises SVG text into a
 * cached texture and re-renders it at the new scale on its own schedule. HTML text is re-laid out with
 * the transform, so it simply tracks. One text pipeline, no second thing to keep in agreement.
 *
 * All of it lives inside one transformed layer, so a single camera moves everything together.
 *
 * The engine owns hit-testing rather than the DOM, so behaviours work identically whichever surface a
 * node is drawn on. That is the property that keeps a dense canvas renderer additive later.

        One box for two states that must never both appear, and never both be absent.

        "Loading" and "nothing to show" answer the same question — why is there nothing here — and as
        two independent conditions they drifted: the empty state was suppressed while loading, so a
        first load left the middle of the canvas genuinely blank and the only word for it was a
        footnote in the far corner. Branching inside one centred box makes them exclusive by
        construction rather than by two conditions agreeing.

        Covers the whole canvas, so it must not intercept anything — an empty graph is still one you
        can pan and drop things onto.
