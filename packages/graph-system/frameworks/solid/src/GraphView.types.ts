 * @ai A general-purpose graph view: knowledge maps, schema maps, hierarchies, cluster maps and

 *
 * The shape of a graph is set by four independent choices: where it starts (`seeds`), how much of it
 * opens (`expansion`), how it is arranged (`layout`), and how it looks (`nodeStyle` / `edgeStyle`).
 *
 * Common recipes:
 * - **Knowledge map** — `seeds: { source: 'query', options: { entity: 'Belief' } }` with
 *   `expansion: { defaultDepth: 1 }` and `layout: { type: 'force' }`.
 * - **Schema map** — `seeds: { source: 'schema' }`, which draws the dataset's own entity types and
 *   the relations between them. Picks up model types added later with no template change.
 * - **Hierarchy** — `layout: { type: 'tree' }` with a `collection` expansion for nested content.
 * - **Static diagram** — `seeds: { literal: true, nodes: [...], edges: [...] }` and no expansion at all.
