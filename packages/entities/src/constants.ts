 * existed before this vocabulary did has tasks whose `status` holds one of these slugs. Reading an
 * empty list as "no states" would empty every board in every existing space, which is a migration
 * dressed up as a default.
 *
 * Creating a single `TaskState` is the act of opting in: from then on the space's own list is the
 * list, and these stop applying. A community that wants to keep "To do" alongside its own additions
 * re-creates it with the same slug, which costs nothing because a task holds the slug rather than a
 * record id.
 *
 * Shaped like the records they stand in for, so a consumer never branches on which it is holding.
