/**
 * The relations every `WeNode` carries — the generic affordances (comments, signals, who is
 * taking part, calls held here, agents mentioned). Declared once and merged into every
 * WeNode-based entity's assembled manifest entry by `index.ts`, exactly as the class hierarchy
 * gives them to every subclass. The prose for each lives on `WeNode.ts`, which remains the
 * hand-written behavioural base these definitions generate subclasses of.
 *
 * `signals` is the one typed edge: `include: { signals: true }` must hydrate `Signal` instances.
 * The rest deliberately name no target — core mints the predicate and stays agnostic about the
 * other end (see the notes on `WeNode.calls`).
 *
 * **Untyped splits two ways here, and only one of them is polymorphic.** `comments` and `calls`
 * hold records — heterogeneous ones, which is the case reading each member as its own class exists
 * for. `participants` and `mentions` hold **agent DIDs**: `setAttending` writes `me.did` and
 * `writeMentions` writes the DIDs its marks name. A DID is not an instance of anything, so
 * classifying one finds no class and hydrating it yields nothing — the read degrades rather than
 * failing, but it is work spent to learn that. They opt out explicitly, which is the whole reason
 * the opt-out exists.
 *
 * Worth noticing as a modelling gap rather than a wart: `target: ''` is currently doing two jobs —
 * "any record" and "not a record at all" — and only the second wants opting out. If a third such
 * relation appears, that is the point to give the manifest a way to say which.
