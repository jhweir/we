       * A dedup key rather than something to display, and it exists because interpretation allows a
       * class exactly one identity property (see {@link TaskBlock.title}). Title alone is the obvious
       * choice and is wrong here in a way that only shows up over time: a weekly standup is the same
       * title every week and a different occasion every week, so a title key silently collapses every
       * occurrence into one record. A date alone is worse — two unrelated things on one afternoon.
       *
       * So the key is composite, and since the mechanism keys on a single property, "composite" has to
       * mean a property whose *value* is composite. Written by the model rather than derived, because
       * machine-written instances go through `create_subject` server-side and never pass WE's own write
       * path, so there is nowhere for us to compute it.
       *
       * **It is denormalised and nothing recomputes it.** Rename the event or move the date and this
       * still says what it said, so the next pass sees a different occasion and writes a new record.
       * That is the accepted cost of a single-property key, and it degrades in the safe direction — a
       * duplicate a human deletes, rather than two real occasions silently merged. It also stays useful
       * once stale: later prompts show it under `properties`, so the model can see what this instance
       * was originally taken to be.
       *
       * Not `required`, deliberately. Required would mean the constructor writing `uninitialized` for
       * every event created by hand through the composer — and then two hand-made events would share a
       * key and dedup into each other, which is the exact failure this field exists to prevent. Left
       * unset, an instance is simply invisible to dedup, which is the right answer for a record no
       * machine is managing.
       *
       * `@Property` rather than `@Optional` even though it is optional: properties are already optional
       * by default, and `@Optional` does not default `resolveLanguage` the way `@Property` does, so the
       * class and its compiled manifest disagree about storage and the round-trip test fails.

       *
       * `we://location` meant two incompatible things. On `Space` it is a relation to a
       * `LocationBlock`; here it was a literal, so anything reading `?x we://location ?y` got a mix
       * of place records and bare strings under one predicate. Sharing a predicate is the point of
       * the vocabulary, and sharing one across two *shapes* is the version of that which cannot
       * work — see `entities/CONVENTIONS.md` on preferring generic predicates.
       *
       * A place is also a thing rather than a word. As a string it could not be put on a map, could
       * not be the same Bristol as the one on another event, and carried nothing an address, a
       * country or a set of coordinates could hang off. `LocationBlock` is where all of that already
       * lives, and `Space` has been using it all along.
       *
       * ## What a pass has to do now
       *
       * Mint the location and link it in the same run. The engine renders forward relations into the
       * prompt and resolves a `new:<Class>:<n>` ordinal into the instance it created earlier in that
       * batch, so this is one proposal, not two round trips — and `LocationBlock.name` is its
       * identity, so a place mentioned three times in a call is one record linked three times.
       *
       * ## What it costs
       *
       * Values already written as strings under this predicate are stranded: the predicate survives,
       * so nothing warns, and a relation read finds no node where a literal sits. Accepted rather
       * than migrated because the alternative is a mapping only the author can supply for data that
       * predates any external consumer — but it is a real loss, deliberately taken, and it is the
       * reason to do this now rather than later.
