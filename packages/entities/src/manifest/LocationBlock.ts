       * ## Why these are optional, and why the default went with the requirement
       *
       * They were `required: true, default: 0`, which sounds like a guarantee and is not one.
       * `minCount` is metadata the executor surfaces rather than a constraint it enforces on write,
       * and the default fires at construction — so a location created without coordinates silently
       * claimed `0, 0`: Null Island, in the Gulf of Guinea. The requirement guaranteed that a number
       * was present, never that it meant anything.
       *
       * So there is no guarantee to lose here, only a lie to stop telling. Optional with no default
       * makes "nobody has placed this yet" representable, and `{ latitude: { exists: false } }` asks
       * for exactly that — a list worth having rather than a gap.
       *
       * ## Why not make the model supply them
       *
       * It would. That is the problem: an LLM produces confident coordinates for "Bristol" and
       * equally confident ones for "the Red Lion on Church Street", and WE draws locations on a
       * globe. A wrong pin is worse than a missing one, because nothing about it looks wrong.
       *
       * Anything plotting these must now skip a location with no coordinates. That is not a new
       * burden: it was already plotting Null Island for every one of them, and this makes the
       * problem visible rather than creating it.
