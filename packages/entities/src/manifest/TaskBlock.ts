/**
 * Interpretation hints: what the LLM is told when this class is an extraction target.
 *
 * They are **prompt payload, not documentation** — the executor puts every property of every
 * selected class into the prompt, each carrying its `hint` and its `required` flag, so a hint costs
 * tokens on every run and a class's whole shape ships whether or not its fields are hinted. That
 * asymmetry is the rule for adding more: hint the fields a person actually says out loud, and keep
 * the class list short rather than the hints short.
 *
 * Two things a hint has to carry that the type cannot. **Closed vocabularies** — `status` and
 * `priority` are `string` in SHACL, so without the allowed values spelled out a model invents
 * `"pending"` or `"urgent"` and the block renders an unrecognised tag. **Exact date formats** —
 * `dueDate` feeds an `<input type="date">` and `EventBlock`'s dates feed `datetime-local`, which
 * are different formats; a value the model formats its own way survives the write and then fails to
 * load into the edit form, which looks like data loss rather than a formatting slip.
 *
 * ## Written permissively, on evidence
 *
 * The first version of these hints was tuned against false positives — a task only if somebody
 * *took it on*, an event only at a *specific agreed time*. Run against a real transcript containing
 * "one task we need to complete is finishing up the model API" and "an event coming up this weekend,
 * going to visit my grandma", it extracted **nothing**, and was right to: neither sentence clears
 * those bars, and speech almost never does.
 *
 * The lesson is about which error is recoverable. A missed task is invisible — nobody knows to look
 * for it, and the transcript scrolls away. An over-eager one is a row a human deletes in a second,
 * and the §4 provenance gate already exists to hold anything contentious for review. So these lean
 * permissive, and the exclusions are only for things that are definitely not the class at all.

       * The task, and its dedup key.
       *
       * `identity` is what makes extraction *converge*. A class that declares none is skipped when
       * the executor assembles the "instances that already exist" block, so the model is never
       * shown it, the deterministic dedup net has nothing to compare against, and every pass mints
       * fresh copies of everything it finds. Without this, pressing Extract twice on one call
       * produced two of every task.
       *
       * It is not what admits a class to extraction — `extractable` on the entity is (a class
       * without an identity property still extracts, it merely duplicates). Which is why an
       * authoring surface offering the one should warn about the absence of the other.
       *
       * It does three jobs at once, which is why the name reads oddly: it selects the human-readable
       * label the model matches against, it is the value compared for equality, and its presence is
       * what puts this class's existing instances in front of the model. Matching is normalised — trimmed, whitespace-collapsed,
       * lowercased — so "Ship  the docs " and "ship the docs" are one task, but "Ship the docs" and
       * "Send the docs" are two. Semantic (embedding) matching exists upstream as a strategy and is
       * the better default here eventually.
       *
       * Title is the right key for a task because a task *is* its statement of work: two calls both
       * saying "finish the model API" mean one task, and that convergence across conversations is the
       * whole point. Contrast {@link EventBlock}, where the same title recurs weekly and means
       * different occasions.

        lets a generated form render a select rather than a free-text box, and it is worth having
