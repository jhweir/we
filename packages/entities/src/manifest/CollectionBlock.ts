       *
       * It is also the *true* question a review surface asks. "Which children are tasks" and "which
       * children came from a pass" answer differently the moment somebody composes a task into a
       * call by hand: the first counts it as extracted, the second does not.
       *
       * ## Why a link rather than a field on the record
       *
       * A property saying which call produced it would be unreadable in one query. An `include` on
       * the call traverses *relations*, so provenance has to be a relation for "everything this call
       * produced" to come back polymorphically in one round trip. Through `children` that question
       * cannot be asked at all: an untyped include is all-or-nothing and carries no class
       * constraint, so it would return every utterance in the transcript alongside the handful of
       * records — which is why the panel had one subscription per model before this existed.
       *
       * Untyped, and deliberately: a pass writes whatever the space has said it may write, which
       * includes shapes a community defined this morning. Unordered, because the sequence that
