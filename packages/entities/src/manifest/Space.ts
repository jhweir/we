       * wanted an opinion added another — a core entity accreting a field on behalf of a module is
       * the shape this replaces.
       *
       * **Absent means "no opinion"**, never "off" — the same rule as `enabledModules`. A level says
       * nothing until somebody sets something, and the resolver takes the most specific level that
       * has an opinion. See `moduleSettings.ts` in the app shell for the order and for how a

       * This field replaced the *shape*, not the three instances of it — and only one of them could
       * move anyway. This resolver answers along one axis, **who is asking**: deployment → agent
       * everywhere → community here → agent here, most specific wins. `autoInterpret` and
       * `extractionTargets` carry a second axis it has no concept of, **which call** — a per-call
       * decision belonging to that call's participants rather than to the space's administrator,
       * held in `CallExtraction` and read through `spaceStore.autoInterpretForCall(collectionId)`,
       * which is a function rather than a value for exactly that reason. Migrating them here as-is
       * would typecheck, pass, and silently drop the layer where participants overrule the space.
       *
       * `shareExtractionDetail` has no such axis and could move. There is no reason to: it is a
       * stored predicate with data behind it, and absent-means-no-opinion makes the move a
       * read-fallback preserving a three-way distinction rather than a rename — against the gain of
       * one fewer column.
       *
       * What was worth fixing is fixed: a capability that wants a setting today declares a
       * `ModuleSetting` and gets a resolved value and a rendered control, so there is no fourth
       * column coming. **Revisit the subject axis when a second capability wants a per-subject
       * override** — one is not evidence the resolver needs one. Recording is the one to watch.
