/**
 * WE's entity vocabulary.
 *
 * Each entity below is exported twice over: as a *type* (its instance shape) and as a *value*
 * that stands in for whichever backend implementation is registered — see entityProxy.ts. A
 * consumer writes `Space.findAll(dataset, …)` and never names a backend; the AD4M adapter
 * registers decorated classes at connect time, and another backend registers its own.
 *
 * The implementations live in each backend's own package — the AD4M classes in
 * `@we/backend-ad4m/src/models`, generated from this package's manifest — and are registered here
 * at connect time. Nothing outside a backend adapter can even name them.
 *
 * Both exports are typed by the NEUTRAL contract — the generated interfaces in
 * `manifest/types.ts` and the `EntityStatic` surface from `@we/backend-shared` — not by the AD4M
 * classes. That is the point of the flip: what a consumer can rely on is what the manifest
 * declares, conformance holds the AD4M lane to it, and this package's `@coasys` edge stops being
 * part of its public face.
