# @we/template-kit — Fragment Authoring Conventions

Rules for adding to or changing this package. The package's purpose and the fragment architecture
live in [README.md](./README.md) and `docs/architecture/template-fragments.md`; this file is the
working ruleset.

These rules also govern **module-provided fragments** — a feature module shipping ready-made
schemas beside its components (`@we/module-graph`'s `fragments.ts` is the first). Same options-object
API, same body style, same doc-comment duty; only the address differs.

## Should this be a fragment at all?

> **Code owns only what data cannot express.** Behaviour and focus management, accessibility
> semantics, browser APIs, measurement, performance-critical rendering — that is the whole list.
> Everything above it is arrangement, and arrangement stays data.

| It wants to be                   | When                                        | Example                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A primitive (`@we/primitives`)   | focus trap, top layer, keyboard, ARIA       | `we-modal`               |
| A component (`@we/components`)   | measurement, layout maths, third-party libs | `AvatarStack`            |
| **A fragment (here)**            | arrangement, however often repeated         | `gatePrompt`, `cardList` |
| A function (`@we/schema-shared`) | computation the expression library lacks    | `plural()`               |

The pairs come apart deliberately: `AvatarStack` is a component (overlap maths) and the count beside
it is a fragment; `we-modal` is a primitive and the confirm dialog inside it is a fragment. When the
repetition is a `value`/`onInput` wiring pattern, check whether it is component-agnostic before
reaching for an operator — `field` stayed a fragment because _which event carries the value_ is
design-system knowledge, and an operator would smuggle that table into the schema resolver.

## When to extract

- **Three real uses of the same shape.** Two is a coincidence.
- **Or the divergence is a bug** — nine lists missing the empty state five others had; four avatar
  stacks seeded with a literal where one had it right.
- **Never speculatively.** A fragment merges in the same commit as the call sites it replaces. An
  export with zero callers is marketplace-vocabulary noise and untested API.
- **Not when the third call site costs three options.** An over-parameterised fragment is worse
  than the duplication, because it also hides it. Leave the odd one hand-written and say why at the
  call site.

## API shape

- **Always a single options object**, never positional arguments — every fragment reads the same
  way at a call site, and options can be added without a migration.
- Types say what a value is for:
  - `string` — plain text the fragment may interpolate (labels it adds a colon to, nouns it
    pluralises). Never accept `Content` where the body does `` `${value}` `` — a token object would
    render `[object Object]`.
  - `Content` (from `types.ts`) — anything legal in a `children` position.
  - `SchemaProp` — an expression: a context ref, a token, a literal.
  - `LocalStateField` — pass-through `$localState` declarations. Import it; don't hand-roll the
    shape.
- An option that only reproduces a difference between two existing call sites is drift being
  promoted to API. Decide which call site is right instead.

## Body style — the fragment reads as the tree it emits

A fragment's body has one special property: it can _look like_ the JSON it produces, which makes it
self-documenting and keeps it visually parallel to its recipe in `@we/ai-context`. Protect that.

- **Name a node only when the output references it more than once** — usually because an option
  rearranges structure and the arrangements share pieces (`agentByline`'s `avatar` in both
  layouts; `confirmModal`'s `close` in three positions). Everything else is written inline, in
  place, however deep.
- **Bulk and comments are never a reason to extract.** A single-use subtree stays inline; the
  comment stays with it.
- **Derived scalars are fine** (`` const key = `${opts.as}Rows` ``), and so is a derived _value_ with
  branching where inlining would nest ternaries inside the tree.
- **The other direction cuts too:** two near-identical branch literals differing in the middle are
  how the marketplace browsers drifted apart. If avoiding that needs many named parts, it is
  usually two fragments.
- Spreads by intent, not habit:
  - value has a default, key always present → `px: opts.px ?? '400'`
  - the key itself is optional → `...(opts.minHeight !== undefined && { minHeight: opts.minHeight })`

## Colour — roles only

Every `bg`, `color` and border colour a fragment emits names a **semantic role** (`surface`,
`text-muted`, `border`, `accent-text`, `danger-text`), never a scale position. A fragment is the
shape many templates inherit, so a `neutral-100` here is a theme-independence bug reproduced at
every call site at once — which is the same reason fragments exist.

`page` / `surface` / `surface-raised` / `surface-sunken` say where the box sits, so pick by what the
fragment actually renders rather than by which grey looked right: a floating panel is `surface-raised`
whatever its shadow, and an inset well inside a card is `surface-sunken`. Text on an accent fill is
`on-accent`; an accent-coloured heading on an ordinary surface is `accent-text`. The full table is
in `@we/ai-context`'s Design System Props fragment, and the reasoning is in
`packages/design-system/1-tokens/CONVENTIONS.md`.

A fragment taking a colour as an **option** should let the caller pass a role and default to one
(`opts.tone ?? 'textMuted'`). The one exception is a palette — a graph fragment colouring nodes by
category is choosing from a scale on purpose, and a theme should not recolour a category into a
status.

## Modals that hold typed content need a discard guard

`we-modal` closes on a backdrop click and on Escape. Both are easy to hit by accident — the backdrop
is every pixel that is not the sheet — and neither is recoverable, because a modal is `$if`-mounted
and closing unmounts the draft with it. **A modal a person can type into must ask before throwing
that away.**

Reach for it by the shape of the modal:

| Writing                   | How                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `formModal`               | `discardWhen: <expression>`                                             |
| `composerModal`           | Nothing — it is on by default; pass `guardDraft: false` to turn it off  |
| A hand-written `we-modal` | `discardGuard({ dirty, close })`, then use all three of what it returns |

`discardGuard` returns three pieces because a modal cannot be guarded from outside it: the flag has
to be declared **on** the modal (so it dies with the draft), the confirmation has to be **inside**
it (so it can read that flag), and `close` has to be **replaced** (so the backdrop asks). Wire the
Cancel button to the same guarded close — one way out of a modal, not two that disagree.

### Writing the `dirty` expression

This is the part that goes wrong, and it goes wrong in one direction: a guard that fires when there
is nothing to lose. **A dialog people learn to click through is worse than no dialog**, because it
costs them the one time it was about something real.

- **Only test what the person typed.** A field with a default and a picker — a status, a mode, a
  colour, an access level — is set from the first frame, so including it makes the guard fire on an
  untouched form. Every guard in the codebase excludes them, and each says so at the call site.
- **A form seeded from a record asks whether it _changed_, not whether it is _filled in_.** The
  blank forms use `{ $: 'local.name || …' }`; an edit form uses
  `{ $: 'local.titleDraft != call.title' }`. Getting this backwards means an edit modal
  reports unsaved work before anybody has touched it.
- **Where the fields are not known in advance, the store answers.** A record form's fields come from
  the model, so no set of local names exists to test — `recordStore.recordDraftDirty` and
  `runtimeStore.aiFormDirty` are the two of these, and both are derived, not stored.
- **Content inside a component is the component's to report.** A `BlockComposer`'s document lives in
  the editor and no local can see it; it pushes `onDirtyChange` instead. Any component that owns
  editable content and can appear in a modal owes the same.

### When to leave it off

A single-field form — "name this board", "name this channel". The guard costs more attention than
one word is worth, and adding it everywhere is how the dialog stops being read. Say so at the call
site so the omission reads as a decision rather than an oversight.

## Panels open with `panelShell`

Anything rendered as a docked panel — a module's `docks` node, a template's `meta.panels` body —
opens with `panelHeader` or `panelShell` from `@we/schema-kit`, and names regions inside itself with
`sectionLabel`. The host's titlebar draws no text, so the name is the panel's to draw; it is not the
panel's to design, and seventeen of them had arrived at five treatments before the fragment existed.

The rules, the two standing exceptions and the reason the title is not simply in the titlebar are in
`docs/architecture/chrome-and-panels.md` § "A panel names itself, once, at the top".

## Ambient scope

Fragments may read locals from ancestors and write results into them — that is what makes
`cardShell` usable without threading `displayMode` through every layer. The costs are borne by
documentation until insert-time checking exists:

- **Every read up the tree and every write into it is declared in the fragment's doc comment**, the
  way `lists/cards.ts` opens with its `displayMode` / `<as>Rows` contract.
- **Only `we/` may name a store.** The tier split is the package's real dependency declaration —
  see README.

## Documentation

- Every fragment carries a doc comment saying **why it exists** — the bug or drift it ended — not
  just what it renders. The kit is also the record of what the shapes learned the hard way (the
  bare-`$item` hash, the collapsing `AvatarStack` row).
- **When an expansion changes materially, update its recipe** in
  `@we/ai-context/src/fragments/patterns.ts`. The recipe and the fragment are two renderings of one
  decision; a drifted recipe teaches the AI a shape the codebase stopped using.
