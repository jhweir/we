/**
 * A kanban board whose columns are records, and whose membership is still a query.
 *
 * ## The one decision everything follows from
 *
 * **State is a fact about the work; position is a fact about the pair.** A task's `status` is read
 * by every surface in WE; where it sits on *this* board is nobody else's business. So a column is
 * two things at once, and the split is deliberate:
 *
 * - **What is in it** comes from the task's `status` matching the column's `slug`. A query, so work
 *   arrives on its own — an extraction pass writes three tasks and no board writes at all, and they
 *   appear on every board that has a column for that state, including one made tomorrow.
 * - **Where each card sits** is the column's ordered `arranges`. Position hints over a membership
 *   defined elsewhere, which is the same relationship AD4M's ordering entries have to the links they
 *   order, one level up.
 *
 * A column is therefore *a saved query with an arrangement*, which is the sentence to keep in mind
 * when this looks like a hybrid. Pure containment — a card is in To-do because To-do holds a link to
 * it — is the obvious alternative and it is the one that breaks: membership then has to be
 * maintained per board forever, a board made tomorrow is empty until somebody backfills it, and its
 * failure mode is a task that is *invisible* rather than one that is visibly misfiled.
 *
 * ## Where the working out happens
 *
 * Not here. Which cards a column shows, in what order, what is left over and what the heading says
 * are one call to `arrangedBoard`, a function the host registers — see its docblock for the rules
 * and for why they moved out of the expression layer. This fragment is arrangement: three
 * subscriptions in, an `$each` over the columns it answers with, a card per row.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of column
 *
 * | | Bound (`slug` set) | Local lane (`slug` empty) |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | Membership | the query above, plus its arrangement | arrangement only |
 * | Dropping a card | writes `status` — every board follows | writes one link — this board only |
 * | New matching work | arrives on its own | never arrives on its own |
 *
 * A lane is how somebody organises without imposing: "Thursday", "Waiting on Ana". Never filling
 * itself is the price of claiming no shared meaning, and it is the right price. A lane that turns
 * out to matter is promoted by naming it in Settings → Vocabulary, which makes it a slug.
 *
 * ## Any record, not only tasks
 *
 * `entity` and `card` let a board arrange something other than `TaskBlock`. A board of records with
 * no state field is a board of lanes, which is the containment kanban — the showcase's Boards
 * template is one, over composed posts. The same fragment, because a lane-only board *is* the
 * special case where nothing binds; see `lanesOnly`.
