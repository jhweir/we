/**
 * Narrowing a whole view to one container — the general form of "the tasks from this call".
 *
 * ## The parameter
 *
 * A view reads its anchor from the URL query parameter `?anchor=<collection id>`. Absent means the
 * whole space, which is what every one of these views has always shown, so nothing about an
 * unanchored view changes.
 *
 * A query parameter rather than a route segment, for two reasons. It is view state by the routing
 * conventions' own test — send somebody the link and they should see what you see — and a segment
 * would make the shell's route tree learn about anchors, which is a fact about a view rather than
 * about where views live. Read straight from `routeStore.params` rather than declared as
 * `$localState` with a `syncParam`, because a view does not *own* this value: it is written by
 * whoever linked here — a call card offering "the work from this call" — and a view that declared
 * it would clear it on mount whenever its own initial disagreed.
 *
 * ## Why absence is safe
 *
 * `scope` is dropped by the renderer when its `anchorId` does not resolve, the same rule
 * `pruneUnresolvedWhere` applies to a `where` — see `scopeIsAnchored`. That is what lets a view
 * carry {@link anchorScope} on every query unconditionally: no `$if` around a duplicated query, no
 * blank screen when nobody named a container. Without it an unresolved anchor would be a perfectly
 * valid request for the children of no record, which answers nothing, silently.
 *
 * ## One level, and that is deliberate
 *
 * `via: 'children'` resolves a single hop: the anchor's own children, not its descendants. Every
 * case that exists today is one level — a call's records hang directly off the call's collection —
 * and recursive resolution costs a traversal per query on a backend where a relation read is a link
 * query. When a real nested case turns up it slots in behind this same parameter, because a view
 * passes the anchor rather than the shape of the walk.

 * query is space-wide.
 *

 * arrives from a link somebody else built, so the reader may never have chosen it. A filter nobody
 * can see is a filter nobody can turn off.
