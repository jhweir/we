/**
 * A link to a record's own page — the affordance that makes the route reachable.
 *
 * A real `href` rather than a click handler, because everything people expect of a link depends on
 * it: middle-click, open in a new tab, copy link address, and the browser's own idea of what has
 * been visited. A `we-button` with `onClick: routeStore.navigate` looks identical and supports none
 * of them. Solid Router resolves the click through `composedPath()`, so the anchor inside the
 * primitive's shadow root is still intercepted and the navigation stays client-side.
 *
 * ## Why the path is built from `spaceStore.spacePath`
 *
 * The route is injected where a shell puts its sections, which for every WE shell is under
 * `/space/:spaceId` — so a bare `/record/…` is a different route entirely and lands on the
 * template's not-found. That was the first version of this, and it 404'd on every click.
 *
 * A *relative* href does not fix it either: a browser resolves one against the current URL, not
 * against the route tree, so `./record/…` is right from `/space/x/cards` and wrong the moment a
 * section has a sub-route of its own. The prefix has to come from the host, and the segment it
 * contains is not a value a schema can compute — for a shared space it is the neighbourhood CID and
 * for a personal one the dataset id.
 *
 * ## Why the id is a query value
 *
 * Because a record's id is a URI — `ad4m://obj/<random>` — and a URI is not one path segment. As
 * `/record/CollectionBlock/ad4m://obj/x` it is five, and the route does not match: the second
 * version of this, which 404'd exactly as visibly as the first. A query value takes `:` and `/`
 * literally, so nothing has to be encoded and nothing has to be decoded back.
 *
 * Takes the entity and the id as expressions so it can be dropped into any `$each` — the row names
 * differ per list, and this has no business knowing them.
 */
/**
 * The route a record's page is mounted at, and the single source of the path in both directions.
 *
 * The link below builds its href *from* this rather than restating it, because restating it is what
 * went wrong: the route said `/record/:entity/:recordId` and the link said `/record/:entity?id=…`
 * for two rounds of testing, and nothing complained. TypeScript sees two strings, the schema
 * validator never resolves an href, and the whole suite passes with a link that matches no route —
 * the only symptom is the template's catch-all, which says nothing about why.
 *
 * The host reads it too, to place the route and to tell its index redirect that `record` is not a
 * section. Three readers, one literal.
