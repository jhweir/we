/**
 * The board fragment is arrangement, and this holds it to that.
 *
 * What a column shows is decided by `arrangedBoard`, a function the host registers, and tested where
 * it lives (`app-shell/tests/arrangedBoard.test.ts`). What is left to check here is that the fragment
 * reaches it — every list on the board reads from the one call — and that the three subscriptions it
 * feeds are the ones the function documents, with no limit on the pool.
