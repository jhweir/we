/**
 * A feed of collections — the shape every container-based surface turns out to be.
 *
 * A channel's messages, a space's posts, a playlist's videos, a board's columns: all of them are
 * "the `CollectionBlock`s of some kind, either inside a parent or loose in the space, newest or
 * oldest first, with something to say when there are none". `cardList` covers the card-grid version
 * of that; this covers the *scoped* version, where the rows belong to a specific parent and the
 * arrangement is the caller's.
 *
 * ## Three things it carries that a hand-written `$each` would not
 *
 * **The scope shape.** Drilling into a container means
 * `scope: { anchor: 'CollectionBlock', via: 'children', anchorId }`, ANDed with a `where` on kind.
 * `children` is an untyped relation, so `include` cannot be used and this is the only form that
 * works — knowledge worth encoding once rather than rediscovering per template.
 *
 * **The mute filter, unconditionally.** Every feed drops muted authors, and it is not optional. A
 * feed either carries that filter from its first use or the ones written later quietly do not, and
 * "the block list works everywhere except the profile grid" is precisely the failure a shared
 * fragment exists to prevent. See `spaceStore.mutedDids`.
 *
 * **The loaded gate.** A query-backed list is empty on its first frame and full a moment later, so
 * an empty state rendered without gating asserts "nothing here" about a list that has not answered
 * yet. Same reasoning as `cardList`'s skeleton branch.

   * Only `createdAt`, and that is a property of what a scoped query *is* rather than a missing
   * capability. The order somebody arranged a container's children into lives on the **relation** —
   * `CollectionBlock.children` is declared `ordered`, so reading the parent returns it — while a
   * `scope` lowers to a filter by parent link, which knows nothing about position.
   *
   * So the two are for different jobs, and this is the paging one: a feed of hundreds of rows wants
   * a limit and a `Load more`, which an ordered relation read cannot give. A surface whose whole
   * point is the arrangement reads the parent instead — see `BoardsView`, which hydrates
   * `children` and gets the order as data.
