/**
 * The shapes WE's templates are built from, as data — the WE-domain tier, plus everything portable.
 *
 * ## Two packages, one import
 *
 * The kit has always had two tiers. The portable one names no store and now lives in
 * `@we/schema-kit`, where a feature module can reach it: the kit sitting under `templates/` made
 * `modules → templates` the only way to use a shape it already had, and that is the sideways edge
 * the dependency rules forbid — so the call module copied `peopleTooltip` by hand instead.
 *
 * What stays here reads WE's own stores (`profileStore`, `runtimeStore`, `datasetStore`) or its
 * schema machinery (`$agent`). That is the tier whose real dependency is the host's store surface,
 * which no `package.json` can express — a fragment naming `spaceStore.members` resolves to nothing
 * on a deployment without that store, silently. Keeping the two apart is how a consumer can tell
 * which fragments will work for them, and it is now a package boundary rather than a directory one.
 *
 * Everything portable is re-exported here, so a template importing `@we/template-kit` sees exactly
 * what it saw before and needs no change. A *module* should import `@we/schema-kit` directly — the
 * narrower dependency is the point, and it is the one that carries no store assumptions.
 *
 * ## What belongs in a fragment at all
 *
 * Code should own only what data *cannot express*: behaviour, focus management, accessibility
 * semantics, browser APIs, measurement. Everything above that line is arrangement, and arrangement
 * stays in a fragment — because a prop is a customisation somebody predicted, while a node tree is
 * every customisation, including the ones nobody thought of.
 *
 * The package README states this rule in full; CONVENTIONS.md carries the authoring rules
 * (extraction threshold, options-object API, the const rule) for both packages; and
 * `docs/architecture/template-fragments.md` is where all of it is going.
