/**
 * Writing a fixture into a dataset, through the model layer the app itself writes through.
 *
 * Not raw rows. `@we/entities` classes are compiled from one manifest into row-backed classes on the
 * in-memory backend and triple-backed ones on AD4M, so going through them is what makes a fixture
 * portable — and, more immediately, what stops a fixture from producing rows that no code path in
 * the app could have produced. A fixture that writes a shape the composer cannot create is a
 * fixture that photographs something users will never see.
 *
 * Everything it writes is **deterministic**: the dataset id, the space uuid and every node id are
 * derived from the fixture rather than minted. The backend is in memory, so ids are remade on every
 * load; without that property a screenshot script could not navigate to a route without first
 * loading the page to discover it, and the second load would produce different ids anyway.
