/**
 * The other five showcase fixtures.
 *
 * Kept in one file because they share a cast and a set of decisions, and splitting them would put
 * five copies of the same four agents in five places. The Discord one lives alone because it is the
 * most structurally involved -- two levels of containment -- and is the worked example.
 *
 * Each is shaped to stress what its layout is actually judged on, not to demonstrate features:
 *
 * - **Twitter** -- replies threaded under a post, one long post beside several short, so the row
 *   rhythm has to survive a 3:1 length difference.
 * - **Instagram** -- a grid with an odd count, so the last row is short and the tile sizing shows.
 * - **YouTube** -- playlists holding videos of very different title lengths, which is where a card
 *   grid usually breaks.
 * - **Kanban** -- an empty column beside a full one, the case a board layout most often gets wrong.
 * - **Events** -- events spread across months, so date grouping and relative timestamps both show.
