/**
 * The fixture format — sample content for a template, described once and applied to any backend.
 *
 * ## Why this is data rather than a script per template
 *
 * A template renders arbitrary community content, so the only way to judge one is to put content in
 * it. An empty Discord clone screenshots as an empty state and says nothing about density, rhythm or
 * how a long message wraps — which is most of what makes a UI recognisable.
 *
 * The format is deliberately expressed in *model* terms (a `CollectionBlock` with a `kind`, a body,
 * an author, a timestamp) rather than in rows, because `@we/entities` compiles from one manifest into
 * row-backed classes on the in-memory backend and triple-backed ones on AD4M, and the difference is
 * invisible to a caller. So the same fixture can serve three consumers:
 *
 * 1. the preview host, which is what exists today;
 * 2. "fill this space with sample content" for a template author working in the real app;
 * 3. marketplace preview images for a `Template` or `Theme`.
 *
 * Only the first is built. The format is shaped for all three anyway, because retrofitting the other
 * two would mean rewriting every fixture.
 *
 * ## The one place the consumers genuinely diverge
 *
 * `author` is a DID this file makes up, and the preview backend can seed a matching profile for it.
 * In a real AD4M perspective the author is the signing agent, so applying a fixture there produces
 * content authored entirely by whoever ran it — every row showing one face, which is exactly what
 * these templates are least able to survive. That is unresolved, and the reason consumer 2 is not
 * built yet rather than being assumed to fall out.
