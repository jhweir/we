 * with a fixed kind is a decision about how this demo works. Promoting it would put a showcase's
 * choices into the shared vocabulary, which is how a kit becomes a framework.
 *
 * The one thing worth stating up front, since all six templates lean on it: **none of these mint a
 * content model.** Every container below is a `CollectionBlock` with a `kind` label this package
 * invented and nothing else has to know about, and a `mode` saying who owns its children. A channel

                  way to say "when my ancestor is hovered". Worth having as a DS capability; until
