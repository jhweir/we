/**
 * Workshop — a call, its transcript, and what came out of it.
 *
 * The seventh showcase template, and the first that is about *panels* rather than about a content
 * arrangement. The other six demonstrate that channels, boards, playlists and events are all one
 * container seen differently; this one demonstrates that where the surfaces around the content sit
 * is also data.
 *
 * ## The screen
 *
 * A call is running. Down the left, the transcript as everyone speaks, and beneath it a readout of
 * what extraction is making of it. On the right, the call itself. In the middle, a board of the
 * records the call produced — tasks and events — which can be dragged into an arrangement and joined
 * to each other.
 *
 * Then two more routes over the same material: the tasks as a list by state, and the events as a
 * month. The panels stand across all three — a panel that survives navigation is the whole
 * difference between one and a region of a page — so moving between them changes the content and
 * leaves the surfaces around it where they are.
 *
 * ## One call, named in the address
 *
 * Every surface here is about one call, and `?call=<id>` is where that id lives — so a reload comes
 * back to the same meeting, the address can be sent to somebody, and the switcher carries it from
 * page to page. Naming none of them means the call being recorded, which is the ordinary case. See
 * `CALL`.
 *
 * ## What it does not mint
 *
 * Nothing. Like the other six, this template adds no content model. The transcript is the
 * `CollectionBlock` `@we/module-transcribe` already writes (`docs/architecture/transcripts.md`), and
 * the board's cards are the `TaskBlock`s and `EventBlock`s extraction already produces from it. The
 * template is arrangement over both.
 *
 * ## Where the panels come from
 *
 * `meta.panels`, and three of the four kinds of entry it can carry:
 *
 * - **`node`** for the extraction readout and the calls list — this template's own schema.
 * - **`module`** for the call stage, which no schema could express, and for the transcript, which
 *   one could and should not. The transcript was a `node` here for one real reason: the module's
 *   panel read the call being *recorded into*, and everything here is about the call *on screen*.
 *   Writing a body bought that and a second copy of the header, the feed and the gating, which
 *   promptly drifted — the copy never gained the module's coverage readout or its capture status,
 *   so the interface built around recording a meeting said less about a failing microphone than the
 *   default one did. Following the address is what any transcript panel should do, so it lives in
 *   the module now and this places it. A body is for an arrangement the module genuinely cannot
 *   express, not for a difference it should have absorbed.
 * - **no `route` on any of them.** The key exists for a shell that routes itself and wants a panel on
 *   one page only — but scoping these to the board meant crossing to the tasks list *unregistered*
 *   them, throwing away their scroll position, their subscriptions and wherever they had been
 *   dragged. A column of context on a page that did not strictly need it is the cheaper of the two.
 * - **`open: false`** on the call, because the call module's launcher action is `goToCall`, which
 *   *joins a call* when there is not one. Placed, never opened.

/**
 * The call on screen — **named in the address**, or the one being recorded when it names none.
 *
 * Every surface here is about one call: the transcript, the extraction readout, the board. That id
 * used to be `modules.transcribe.collectionId`, which means "the call I am recording into" — so
 * looking at a finished call meant *joining a call* first, a refresh left the template about no call
 * at all, and there was no way to send somebody the board you were looking at. In the address
 * instead, which answers all three: it survives a reload, pastes into a message, and needs no state
 * anywhere. The live call is the default, so the ordinary case — you are in a meeting, you open the
 * board — is unchanged and names nothing.
 *
 * ## A query parameter, not a path segment
 *
 * `/board/<call>` was the obvious spelling and it cannot work: a record id is a **URI**
 * (`we://…/<uuid>`), so it carries slashes and a colon, and `./board/we://…` is several segments —
 * `/board/:callId` matches none of them, and every click landed on the catch-all with "Page not
 * found". A query value takes those characters as they are, which is why the host's own record
 * links are `…/record/<Entity>?id=<id>` and not a segment either.
 *
 * ## The call module, not the transcriber
 *
 * The fallback asks **the capability that owns the fact**. `modules.transcribe.liveCollectionId`
 * means "the record I am writing into", and the transcriber only adopts the call's record when it
 * first has something to write — so for the whole opening stretch of a meeting its honest answer is
 * "nothing", and every surface here waited for somebody to speak before it would admit a call was
 * happening. The record exists from the first second: `startCall` writes it before anyone joins and
 * publishes it on presence. `callRecordId` is that, which is the question these surfaces are
 * actually asking.

 * grew. It grew: what a space extracts is a community decision now, and the extraction panel offers
 * it as chips somebody can change mid-call. So the constant went from a maintenance note to a bug

    **One** navigation, path and query together.

    It was two actions, a `navigate` then a `setParam`, and they raced. The router commits a
    navigation in a transition rather than synchronously, so `setParam` — which writes
    `window.location.pathname + '?…'` straight through `history` — read the *old* pathname and wrote
    the parameter onto it; the router's own write landed afterwards. The parameter took effect (the
    panels followed it, which is why this looked half-working) and the address ended up somewhere no
    route matched, so every route said "Page not found". Nothing that navigates and sets a parameter
    can be two steps.

    Absolute, from `spaceStore.spacePath`. A relative path resolves against wherever the click came
    from, and most of these clicks are on a **panel** — host chrome, rendered outside the route tree
    — so "wherever you are" is not a thing they can rely on. The switcher's own buttons are inside
    the tree, and even they are absolute now that they carry a query: a relative path with a `?` is
    where resolution rules and remembered query strings meet.

    The id rides in the query rather than a path segment because it is a URI; see `CALL`. Raw, as the

 * ## Nothing here names a property of anything
 *
 * Which is the point, and the case that prompted it: a community defines a model, extraction writes
 * one, and it appears on the board as a card nobody can look inside. `recordStore.displays` is
 * derived from the model's own declaration, so the fields, their labels and their kinds all arrive
 * from the same place the create form gets them. A model adopted this morning renders here with
 * nothing written for it.

      The decision, on the card that raised it.

      A suggestion is resolvable from the extraction panel too, and that is the right surface for

      of you: the card is what asked the question, so finding its line in a list somewhere else and
      matching the two up by reading is work the board created and should absorb.

      cross appear on exactly the cards the rule above faded — one fact, read twice, which is what
      stops the two from ever disagreeing. `data.` prefix included: see the note up there.

      Delete appears once a card is settled, and not before. On a suggestion it would be a second
      button that looks like it does the same thing as the cross — and it is not the same thing:
      discarding resolves the suggestion, where deleting only removes the record and leaves the
      staged overlay behind it, so the extraction panel would go on offering a decision about
      something that no longer exists. Two buttons, one of them subtly wrong, is worse than one.

      `{ exists: false }` rather than `{ not: true }`, because the seed writes the flag only on the
      cards it applies to — "not pending" is the absence of the field, which is what this asks.

      It is still offered on everything else. Extraction proposes things that are simply wrong about
      a conversation, and until now the only way to remove one that had been accepted was to find it
      in another view.

/**
 * The events, as a month.
 *
 * The counterpart to the tasks list, and the same argument: a conversation produces two kinds of
 * commitment, one with a date on it and one without, and neither stops mattering because the meeting
 * ended. So this is every `EventBlock` in the space rather than this call's — the calendar answers
 * "what is coming", which is a question about the community and not about a recording.
 *
 * It replaces the archive of past calls, which the calls panel does better and from every route.
 *
 * ## Why a grid built out of nodes rather than the `Calendar` component
 *
 * `Calendar` owns its own grid and can only be styled from outside; every cell here is the
 * template's, which is what lets a fork turn a title chip into a count, a heat square or a week
 * view without touching code. The one thing a schema cannot compute for itself — which weekday the
 * 1st falls on, how long a month is, how many cells make whole weeks — comes from `calendarMonth()`,
 * a host function. Code answers the arithmetic; the drawing is data. The same division `CalendarView`
 * makes, and the second of the two surfaces that make it.
 *
 * ## Dates
 *
 * `startDate` is `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm` and a cell is a day, so the match is `startsWith` over the
 * cell's date — exact for a fixed-width datetime, where a `YYYY-MM-DD` substring can occur nowhere
 * but position 0. It is a `filter()` over the month's own hoisted query rather than a `$query` per
 * cell: one subscription sifted 42 times, against 42 subscriptions for rows already in hand.

      tasks list *unregistered* both panels, so their scroll position, their subscriptions and
      wherever they had been dragged were destroyed and rebuilt on the way back. Panels that survive
      navigation is the whole difference between a panel and a region of a page; scoping them by
      route gave that up to save a column of context nobody minded.

      Left standing, they cost nothing to switch between: the declaration is unchanged across a route
      change, so nothing is announced and nothing re-registers.

      The call is placed on every route and opened by none of them — see `open` in `TemplatePanel`.

        The transcribe module's panel, placed. Nothing else — no body of our own.

        There was one, for one reason: the module's panel read `modules.transcribe.collectionId`,
        the call being *recorded into*, and the call on screen here is whatever the path names, so
        placing it would have put one surface about a different call beside three about this one.
        Supplying a body bought that at the price of a second copy of the header, the feed and the
        gating — and the copy drifted exactly as a copy does. It never gained the module's coverage
        readout or its capture status, so this template silently said less about a failing
        microphone than the default one did, and a fix to the transcript's scrolling landed on one
        of the two.

        The answer was never a second panel. "Show the call the address names, else the live one" is
        what a transcript panel should do everywhere, so it moved into the module — see `SUBJECT` in
        its `Panel.schema.ts` — and this went back to being what a template's panel entry is for:
        where the thing goes.

        `dock` still names which of the module's two panels this is. It is no longer load-bearing —
        without a `node` there is nothing to supply — but it is what says the entry means the
        transcript rather than the extraction readout, and the entry below is its pair.

          the *live* call while the results below them were the addressed one's, so a past call's

    zero. The board grew; the percentage inside it did not.

    stopping at the fold under a long task list — belongs to the scroll container above, which paints
    `page` across its whole scrollable area and says so. A tall route overflows this box, is not
