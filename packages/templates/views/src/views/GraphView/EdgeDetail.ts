/**
 * A drawn connection, opened.
 *
 * The reason `Relationship` is an entity rather than a link is that a claim two things are related
 * is exactly the kind of claim people argue about — and this is where the arguing happens. Reading
 * it back has to offer everything a `WeNode` carries: who said it, what they said, what the
 * community thinks of it, and the thread underneath.
 *
 * ## Why a modal and not the strip
 *
 * A clicked *node* gets the strip along the bottom, which is right: it names one thing and gets out
 * of the way, because the map is what you are looking at. A connection is the opposite — you clicked
 * it to find out what somebody meant by it — and a thread cannot live in a bar one line tall.
 *
 * ## Why it queries rather than reading the edge
 *
 * `onEdgeClick` hands over the *drawn* edge: its label and its scalars, which the expander flattened
 * out of the record. That is everything the map needed and none of what a discussion needs — no
 * comments, no signals, no author. `reifiedAs` keeps the record reachable, which is what it is for,
 * and `$single` fetches the thing itself.
 */

/**
 * The record behind the clicked edge.
 *
 * `onEdgeClick` resolves it out of `reifiedAs` and hands it over as `recordId` — a template has no
 * operator that could take a graph address apart, so the event answers the question it raises.
 * Absent on an ordinary edge, which stands for a declared relation and has no record; the modal's
 * condition is exactly that absence, so clicking one opens nothing.
