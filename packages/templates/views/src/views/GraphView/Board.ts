/**
 * The board — the same engine, with position as the data.
 *
 * Every other mode on this route *derives* an arrangement: force settles a knowledge map, tree
 * ranks containment, the schema map is laid out from relations nobody chose. A board is the one
 * where somebody put a thing somewhere because that is what they meant, and the layout's whole job
 * is to leave it alone. `manual` reads each card's own `x`/`y`; `drag-node` with `pin: true` is what
 * makes a dropped card stay dropped rather than being reclaimed on the next change; and
 * `onNodeDragEnd` writes the drop back, which is the only reason any of it survives a reload.
 *
 * ## What a card is
 *
 * A `CollectionBlock`, parented to the board through `we://children` — which is to say, a post that
 * happens to live on a board. That is not a shortcut: it means a card holds composed content
 * (`BlockComposer` writes it, `BlockRenderer` reads it), carries comments and signals like anything
 * else, and is found by everything that already walks a collection. Nothing here is board-shaped
 * except the two numbers.
 *
 * ## Reading and editing
 *
 * A card draws its real content — `content: 'block'` mounts the same renderer a post card uses — so
 * a note holding a photo and three paragraphs looks like one rather than like sixty characters of
 * its first line. Clipped, not scrolled: a card is a preview, and what does not fit is reached by
 * opening it.
 *
 * Editing is that modal rather than the canvas. Text entry inside a transformed, zoomable surface is
 * its own piece of work — the engine's notes have said so three times — and once the content is
 * *visible* in place, the remaining value of typing in place is small next to what it costs. Worth
 * revisiting after this has been used, not before.
