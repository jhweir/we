/**
 * The canvas's key — what kinds of thing are on it, and what colour each one is.
 *
 * A legend that is also a control. Reading a canvas means knowing what the colours mean, and the
 * moment that is on screen the natural next thought is "make decisions amber" — so the key is where
 * the colour is *set*, not a caption describing a decision made somewhere else. It is also the only
 * surface that can say something about a type at all: the detail panel is about the card you
 * selected, and "every task on this canvas" has no card to select.
 *
 * ## Why it is toggleable rather than always there
 *
 * A canvas with three kinds of thing on it does not need a key, and a panel explaining what you can
 * already see is a panel covering the thing you are trying to look at. It opens on request and
 * remembers that per device — a preference rather than view state, since a link's recipient should
 * see the canvas, not somebody else's chrome.
 *
 * ## Where the list of types comes from
 *
 * The placements, ordered by type, with consecutive repeats suppressed — the `$prev` grouping
 * pattern, used for exactly what it is for. The schema layer has no "distinct", and the alternatives
 * were worse in ways that show: listing the space's models would name kinds that are not on this
 * canvas, and a store accessor would have to be told which canvas it was being asked about.
 *
 * That means the key lists what has been *placed*. A card sitting in the tray, put on the canvas but
 * never positioned, is not in it yet — which is consistent with the rest of the mode, where being
 * placed is what being on a canvas means.
 *
 * ## What this becomes
 *
 * Colour by type is the first rule and not the last: colour by task status, by author, by how
 * recently something changed. Each of those is a rule with a field and a mapping rather than one
 * colour per type, and this is the surface they belong on — which is why the record behind it is
 * called `TypeStyle` and lives on the canvas rather than being a colour field on the type.

/**
 * The key's dock: always mounted, on the right edge, and inert until something is in it.
 *
 * A `$if` with a transition wraps its content in an animation container positioned *from* that
 * content, so an absolutely positioned panel inside one is placed against the wrapper's box rather
 * than the canvas's. Docking it in a container that is always there and always where it says it is
 * takes the question away from the wrapper entirely.
 *
 * Right, because the detail panel took the left: the module rail runs down the right edge of the app
 * and overlaps whatever a route puts there, and of the two panels the key is the one that can afford
 * to lose a strip — it is read at a glance and dismissed, where the detail panel is worked in.
 *
 * `top` and `bottom` rather than a height, so the column is as tall as the canvas whatever resolves:
 * a percentage height needs an unbroken chain of resolved heights above it, and where that chain
 * breaks the panel is merely short, with its border stopping in mid-air.
 *
 * `pointerEvents: 'none'` because a 260px column down the side of the canvas would otherwise eat
 * every click on the canvas behind it while the key is closed; the panel inside turns them back on.
