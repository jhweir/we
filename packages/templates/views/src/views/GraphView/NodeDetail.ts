/**
 * The selected node, opened out — a panel over the right edge of the canvas.
 *
 * A graph draws structure and hides everything else, which is what makes it readable and also why a
 * node on its own says almost nothing: a dot labelled "Ship the docs" is a record with six fields
 * and the map shows one of them. Somewhere has to answer "what is this", and that is host territory
 * rather than engine — the engine already hands over the node.
 *
 * ## Why a panel and not the strip it replaces
 *
 * This was a row along the bottom, and the shape was wrong for what it holds. A strip is **wide and
 * shallow** and a record's fields are a **list**: every field got one line of height and a share of
 * fourteen hundred pixels of width, so six of them read as a smear. A column can afford two lines
 * per field — the name above the value — which is what makes them scannable at all.
 *
 * ## Why it overlays rather than pushing the canvas
 *
 * Pushing means resizing the graph surface, which changes the world rectangle on screen: selecting a
 * card near the right edge would shift what you are looking at, and the node being described can
 * slide underneath the thing describing it. Overlaying leaves the camera exactly where it was.
 *
 * ## Two questions, two surfaces
 *
 * This one answers *what is this* — type, fields, what it connects to. Reading the *document* is the
 * modal's job, because a post in a three-hundred-pixel column is worse than a post in a modal, and
 * metadata in a modal is worse than metadata in a panel: it demands dismissal for something you
 * wanted at a glance. So the panel describes, and offers `Open`.

 * you last asked. Without the second, dismissing the panel once would mean selecting anything
 * afterwards silently did nothing visible. Handler arrays run in order, so both land with the
