        No background here, deliberately.

        A `bg` on this container is dead: `GraphView` paints its own, defaulting to `neutral-0`, and
        covers whatever is behind it. A template that wants a different canvas colour sets the
        graph's `bg` prop — putting one here looks like it works and does nothing, which is how the
        detail panel ended up the same colour as the canvas it sits on.
