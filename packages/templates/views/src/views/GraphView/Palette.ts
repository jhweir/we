/**
 * The colours a board can be painted with, and the row that picks one.
 *
 * Shared between the card's own colour and the key's colour-per-type, because they are the same
 * choice made about different things — and a palette that drifted between the two would let somebody
 * colour a card in a shade no type could ever be given, so the key could never account for it.
 *
 * ## Why tokens rather than a colour picker
 *
 * A token keeps meaning the same thing when the theme changes; a hex chosen against a light theme is
 * a hole in a dark one. A board is a shared artifact that outlives whichever theme it was made
 * under, and every other colour in WE already answers to the theme — a card that did not would be
 * the one thing on screen that ignores it.
 *
 * The empty token is a *swatch*, not a Reset button beside them. It has to be pickable, because it
 * is the way back to being coloured by the rules — for a card, by its type; for a type, by the
 * board's defaults — and a control that can only ever add an override is a one-way door.
