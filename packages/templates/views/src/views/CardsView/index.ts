      Whether the Calls list shows calls nobody said anything in.

      A call's record is now created when the call *starts* rather than when somebody first speaks,
      which is what gives a live call an identity to hang its settings and its roster on — and the
      cost is that a call somebody opened and closed leaves a record behind. Nothing deletes it: the
      only agent who could judge an empty call discardable is one who can see the whole call, and
      under a partition that is nobody, so a delete would eventually eat a transcript that existed
      on the other side of the split.

      So it is folded rather than removed, which is a display decision and reversible. Persisted
      rather than synced: it is a preference about how much noise you want, not something a shared
      link should impose.
