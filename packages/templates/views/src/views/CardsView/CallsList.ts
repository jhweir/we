/**
 * Recorded calls in this space.
 *
 * A call's record is a `CollectionBlock` with `kind: 'call'` — its utterances are the children, its
 * roster is `participants`, and it hangs off whatever node the call was about via `WeNode.calls`.
 * So this is an ordinary entity list like every other section here; no new machinery.
 *
 * The shape is `docs/architecture/transcripts.md`. `'call'` is spelled here rather than imported
 * because `templates → modules` is a sideways edge; that page lists everyone else who spells it.
 *
 * **A record exists if and only if somebody spoke while transcription was on.** It is created on the
 * first utterance rather than when a call starts, so this list is not call history — a call nobody
 * recorded leaves nothing, by design. Call history for every call is a separate feature with a
 * different creation policy, and smuggling it in through this one would produce a lot of empty rows.
 *
 * `kind` is queried rather than a tag: it is a scalar, so `eq` pushes down to the backend and
 * composes with `order` and `limit`. A tag relation would need a traversal in the direction the
 * query layer does not go.

 * `EventBlock`, so a community that defined a `Sighting` and had one extracted saw the record land
 * in the space and never appear on the call it came out of.
 *
 * A drill-down through `children` rather than an `include`, and the reason has changed since this
 * was written. It used to be that `include` had no target class to resolve on an untyped relation
 * and died on it; that relation is read polymorphically now and an include works. The drill-down

/**
 * What extraction wrote onto this call, one group per model this space can extract into.
 *
 * The list of models comes from `shapeStore.extractionCandidates` — everything that *could* be
 * extracted here, rather than what this call is currently looking for. Deliberately the widest of
 * the three layers: a record found an hour ago is still on this call after its target is switched
 * off, and a card that hid it would be reporting the setting rather than the conversation.
 *
 * Each group hoists its own subscription and renders only when it has members, so a call nobody
 * extracted from looks exactly as it did before, and a space with no extractable models grows
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * How a record is drawn comes from its own declaration (`recordStore.displays`), with the entity
 * name and a neutral icon where a model has no display — an extraction target need not be one of
 * the models a person can create by hand. `title` is all this shows: the point is "this came out of
 * this conversation", not a task manager, and anything richer belongs in the card for that type.
 *
 * The fold this used to sit behind is gone with the hardcoded queries. It counted tasks and events
 * in its own label ("Show what was found · 2 tasks"), and a total across a set of models nobody
 * knows in advance is not something a schema can compute — the counts live inside the groups, one
 * query each. No loss: `cardShell` already folds the whole card, and the note on the transcript
 * below records what happened the last time this route had two disclosures in a row.

                            month — so the button beside it, which now offers something different for

                            Compared against the transcript's live record rather than against a flag,
                            because "in a call" and "in *this* call" are different questions and only
                            the second one belongs on a card. A space-wide call publishes one call id
                            derived from the space, so it names the place calls happen and could never
                            tell this morning's from this afternoon's; the record can.

                            Its own words, not only a colour: `danger` is the app's word for something
                            being wrong, and a live conversation is not. A tag reads correctly for
                            somebody who cannot separate the hues, and needs no motion — a theme's
                            reduced-motion setting zeroes the animation tokens, so anything relying on
                            a pulse to be noticed is invisible to those users.

                          node, writes records, and announces nothing — so a call with nothing found

                          Reads the space setting rather than the engine's own progress. The engine
                          does emit per-pass steps, and surfacing those ("last pass 2 minutes ago")

                          A transcript's record is reachable only while somebody who was in the call
                          is still publishing a claim to it, so once everyone has left it can never be
                          added to again. That is the right default — the next conversation in a space
                          is a different meeting, and a call that resumed itself would swallow it — but
                          it leaves no way back into one that ended because the network dropped, or
                          because everyone stepped out for five minutes.

                          Offered to everyone, unlike edit and delete: continuing a call is joining a
                          conversation, not editing somebody's record of one.

                          ## Why it stops meaning "continue" the moment you are in a call

                          It used to be the two actions below unconditionally, and mid-call each one
                          did something nobody asked for. `goToCall` is a no-op on the call you
                          are already in and a silent teardown of any other — the same hazard the
                          module rail's launcher had. `resume` is worse, because it does not fail
                          quietly: it re-points the live transcript at *this* record and announces the
                          claim, and peers adopt an announced record in preference to their own. One
                          stray click on last month's card moved everybody's live transcript into last
                          month's meeting.

                          ## Why a card that is not the live one offers nothing at all

                          The first fix was to make every card say "Go to the call" mid-call, and it
                          was wrong for a reason that only shows up on a list: this button sits beside
                          one particular conversation, so "the call" reads as *this* card's call. A
                          row of finished meetings all offering to take you to a call, none of them
                          the call in question, is a worse answer than no button.

                          So the control is offered in exactly the two states where it has an
                          unambiguous subject: no call running, where it continues this one; and this
                          card *being* the running call, where "go to the call" can only mean the one
                          it is attached to. Anything else is absent.

                          Absent rather than disabled. A disabled `we-button` sets the native
                          attribute, and a disabled control does not reliably deliver hover to the
                          tooltip that would explain it — so the explanation is the part that goes
                          missing, leaving an inert button that cannot say why. There is nothing to
                          explain here anyway: the call bar is on screen and the rail tab is lit, so
                          "you are in a call" is already said twice.

                          What this call's pass is doing, and — only when it found nothing — that it did.

                          A spinner inside a 32px button is not, on its own, an answer to "did my click
                          land" — the run takes tens of seconds against a remote model, which is long
                          enough to press again, or to conclude it is broken. So the state is also said
                          in words beside it.

                          It used to say `${count} found` on a hit, and that has to go: the count came
                          from `extractCount`, which is *this agent's last press* — so it ignored what
                          auto-extraction wrote, it survived leaving and re-entering the route (the
                          module store outlives navigation), and it sat directly above the findings
                          groups, which count what is actually attached. Two numbers about the same
                          card, disagreeing. The groups are the truthful one, so the press now says
                          nothing on a hit and lets them answer.

                          Zero is the case that still needs words, and is why this is not deleted
                          outright: nothing renders below when nothing was found, so without a sentence
                          "it worked, there was nothing in this conversation" and "it silently failed"
                          look identical. Both remaining states are scoped to this card's id, so
                          nothing ever appears on a card that did not ask for it.
