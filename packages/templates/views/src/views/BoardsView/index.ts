/**
 * Boards — this space's work, arranged.
 *
 * The one task surface. There was a Tasks route beside this one, showing the same work with columns
 * from the space's vocabulary and no arrangement; it is gone, and its space-wide reading is the
 * **Everything** board at the top of this list. Two routes over one set of records disagreed about
 * what a column was, and only one of them could record an order.
 *
 * ## What a board is
 *
 * A `CollectionBlock` (`kind: 'board'`) whose ordered `children` are **column records**, each
 * holding its own ordered cards. The full reasoning — why a column is a saved query rather than a
 * container, why that is what survives a partition, and how swimlanes would fit — is
 * `docs/architecture/boards.md` and the docblock on `taskBoard`. The short version:
 *
 * - **A board never owns its work.** Delete a column and its cards keep their state, so they turn up
 *   in another column bound to it or in Unplaced. Delete the board and nothing is lost at all.
 * - **A card appears the moment it exists.** Extraction writes a state and no board links, so a
 *   board made tomorrow shows yesterday's work without anyone backfilling anything.
 * - **The same card sits differently on two boards, and is in one state on both.** Position is a
 *   fact about the pair; state is a fact about the work.
 *
 * ## Everything, and the boards people make
 *
 * The first row is the space's own board, made the first time somebody opens it — on a *click*
 * rather than on the route mounting. Creating a board writes records into a space everybody shares,
 * and doing that as a side effect of navigating would have every member who opened the tab racing to
 * create the same one.
 *
 * ## Anchoring
 *
 * `?anchor=<collection id>` narrows the list to the boards inside one container, and each board's
 * cards to that container's work. A board made while narrowed belongs to it. Absent means the space.
 */

/**
 * The board its container calls its own — the space's, or the anchored container's.
 *
 * Which board is canonical is a fact about the **container**, so it is read from `Space.board` and
 * `CollectionBlock.board` rather than from a marker on the board. A marker could not stop two boards
 * claiming it; a single-valued link converges, and the board that loses the race is simply an
 * ordinary one in the list.
