/**
 * The space's tasks, as a board.
 *
 * ## Columns come from `status`, not from containment
 *
 * This is the opposite choice from the showcase `KanbanTemplate`, which makes a card's *column* its
 * status — boards and columns are `CollectionBlock`s there, and moving a card is a relink. That is
 * the more general model and it is right for a board somebody builds by hand: a community invents
 * whatever columns it needs, and the card and the board cannot disagree because there is only one
 * fact.
 *
 * It cannot work here, and the reason is extraction. A task written by a model has no column,
 * because the engine emits forward relations from the instance it creates and a card's membership
 * is a link from the *column* — the wrong direction. Nothing could put it on a board without either
 * a second truth on the task or a designated inbox column that every extracted task piles into
 * regardless of what it is about. Meanwhile the model does fill `status`, from a closed vocabulary,
 * because that is a property of the work.
 *
 * So this route reads `status` and a hand-built board reads containment, and the two are different
 * templates over the same records rather than two truths inside one. The kit's own warning applies
 * and is worth restating: **do not mix them in one view.** A status dropdown beside containment
 * columns is the disagreement both designs exist to avoid.
 *
 * The consequence worth naming: these three columns are a fixed vocabulary, where a hand-built
 * board's are not. That is the trade — a task appears here the moment a model finds it, and nobody
 * can invent a fourth column. Columns as saved queries would give both, and is where this goes.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 *
 * By creation, and no drag-to-reorder — the same constraint the kit's board documents. Ordering
 * within a column needs a conflict-free position (the AD4M CRDT work); a `position` scalar written
 * now is a shape that design supersedes.

        The cards, in a drop zone.

        `zone` is the status, which is what makes the drop handler a one-line `record.update`: the
        event says which zone an item landed in, and here a zone *is* a status. A containment board
        would read the same event and relink instead — the primitive reports intent and stays out of
        it.

        `group` is what lets the three columns exchange cards while leaving every other sortable on
        the page — the space sidebar, for one — out of it.

        `index` is deliberately ignored, so a drag across columns persists and a drag within one is
        visual only.

        This used to say it was waiting on the AD4M CRDT ordering work. That has landed, and it is
        not enough — the note was pointing at the wrong thing. Ordering is a property of a
        *relation's membership*: the array you assign to a relation is the array you get back. A
        column here is a **query**, `where: { status }` over every `TaskBlock` in the space, and a
        filtered query has no membership to order. There is nothing for an ordering to attach to.

        What is actually undecided is whether a column is a query or a container. Make it a
        container — a `CollectionBlock` per column, tasks as its `children`, status expressed by
        which one holds them — and order comes free, a cross-column drag becomes `moveChild`, and
        `we-sortable`'s `index` starts meaning something. The cost is that a task then has to be
        *placed* to appear at all, so a `TaskBlock` written by extraction or by any other surface
        stops showing up here until something parents it, and `status` becomes a denormalised copy
        of where it lives. That is a modelling decision about what a board *is*, not a missing
        capability, and it should be made deliberately rather than arrived at by adding a scalar.

        A `position` scalar remains the wrong answer for the reason it always was: two people
        reordering the same column write the same numbers and one of them loses.

          you most need to drop into, an empty one. The column around it looked droppable (it has the
          minimum height and the border that make it read as a trough) and was not: the pointer was
          over the `Column`, which is not a zone.

          `flex: '1'` takes the height the trough already reserves, and `width: '100%'` the width its
