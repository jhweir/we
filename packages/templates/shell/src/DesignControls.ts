/*
  Not `.schema.ts`, and that is the point.

  Everything here is a *builder* with an ambient contract: `templatePicker()` reads
  `local.templatePickerOpen`, which the rail that composes it declares. `.schema.ts` means "this
  file exports a schema the validator can judge on its own", and one of these judged alone reports
  ten errors about state it was never meant to own — which is why they were functions in the first
  place (see the note on `templatePicker`).

  So the file said "no schema export found" on every validation run: a warning that was accurate
  about a file that is correctly outside the walk, and which had to be read and dismissed each time.
  The composed rail *is* validated, and that is where these are covered.

/**
 * Choosing a template and choosing a theme — the two pickers that live in the chrome rail.
 *
 * ## Why these are data
 *
 * They were 1200 lines of TSX in `@we/editor`, pinned to the top-right corner of the window in a
 * band no layout calculation reserved — so every template drew its own header into space the app
 * believed was free, and the chips were covered or in the way depending on the page. Moving them
 * into the rail fixes the collision; expressing them as schema is what makes them forkable when
 * chrome becomes a marketplace category, and what let the two of them stop drifting apart.
 *
 * Everything they touch is already granted: `appearance` covers reading the lists and switching,
 * `editor` covers entering an editing session, and `library` covers publishing. See
 * `app-shell/src/shared/registries/templateSurface.ts`.
 *
 * ## Both halves in one file
 *
 * They are the same surface twice over, and they have been rewritten in parallel twice already.
 * Side by side, a change to one is visibly a change the other did or did not get.
 *
 * ## What stayed in code
 *
 * The editing bar — undo/redo, preview/visual, share, exit. Those act on a live editing session
 * rather than on a choice, they must stay on screen continuously while editing, and they are what
 * `mountTemplateEditor` gives an embedding application through `EditorHost`. See `EditingBar.tsx`.
