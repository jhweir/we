 * Shell Sidebar
 *
 * Persistent app chrome sidebar that wraps around the active template.
 * Provides: template/theme switching, current space info, installed apps, logout.
 *
 * Registered in slotRegistry as `core:sidebar` (anchor: dock-left), alongside the boot screen and
 * template editor.
 * Only visible when the user is logged in (boot state === 'ready').
 *
 * Built from `@we/template-kit`'s `railShell`/`railGroup`/`railItem` fragments — the fragments
 * replaced this shell's original `CollapsibleSidebar` widget once they had been lived with; see
 * `packages/templates/kit/src/layout/rail.ts` for why a node tree is the right shape for a rail.

      Apps — embedded external apps, with WE itself as the first entry.

      ## Why the guard counts `apps` while the list iterates `appsWithWe`

      Not a slip. `appsWithWe` prepends a `WE` sentinel whose row means *get back out of an app* —
      which is meaningless when there is no app to be in. So whether the group exists at all is a
      question about the **external** apps, and only the rows inside it include WE.

      Written the obvious way — counting the same list it iterates — the condition would be true in
      every deployment, since the sentinel is always there. That was the actual behaviour until now:
      a deployment configuring no apps still got an "Apps" group containing a lone "WE" row, which
      is a heading over a control that does nothing.

      ## Why this is a condition rather than a deletion

      WE's own seed no longer lists any apps, so this renders nothing here today. That is a
      *deployment* decision and it belongs in the seed, which is the thing that describes a
      deployment — this template is shared by all of them, and deleting the group outright would
      take the capability away from a deployment that wants it rather than from ours that does not.

      Removing the entry from the seed also stops the app being *fetched*: `PersistentAppFrames`
      mounts an iframe per registered app eagerly, and a `display: none` ancestor does not stop an
      iframe loading its `src` — so hiding this group alone would have left a remote request at
      every boot for something nobody could reach.
