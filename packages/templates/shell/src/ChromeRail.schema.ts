/**
 * The chrome rail — one edge, holding everything the host puts on screen permanently.
 *
 * ## Why the host owns this
 *
 * The first two modules to need an entry point each invented their own: notes put a tab at the right
 * edge, calls put a pill in a corner. Both worked in isolation and looked like an accident together,
 * and a third module would have made it three. A module knows what its launcher *means*; only the
 * host knows where launchers go and can keep them from colliding.
 *
 * So a module declares `launcher: { icon, label, action }` and contributes no chrome for it. This
 * renders them all, in registration order with the same id tiebreak the slot registry uses, so the
 * rail cannot reshuffle depending on which module loaded first.
 *
 * ## Why it is no longer only about modules
 *
 * It never quite was — it has carried the way into a space's settings for as long as it has existed,
 * because that is where a module gets turned back on, and those settings are a panel on this edge
 * like any module's. It now also carries the template and theme pickers, which used to be a strip of
 * chips pinned to the top-right corner.
 *
 * Those chips were the one piece of persistent chrome no layout calculation knew about: `SIDEBAR_PX`
 * reserves the left edge and `contentInset` moves content out of a docked panel's way, but nothing
 * reserved the band across the top, so every template drew its own header into space the app believed
 * was free. Two pieces of chrome in two corners also meant two things to dodge; one rail is one.
 *
 * ## Why the right edge
 *
 * It is the emptiest edge in WE's layout: the sidebar owns the left and the call bar owns the bottom
 * centre. A docked module panel takes that edge outright and slides the rail inwards by its width, so
 * the rail stays reachable while a panel is open rather than being covered by it — and the panel is
 * not stranded in the middle of the edge with chrome on both sides.
 *
 * The editor's panels take the same edge and get the same treatment, through the same variable: they
 * are docks themselves now, so opening one slides this rail exactly as opening a notes panel does.
 *
 * ## What is gated on what
 *
 * Module enablement is per-space, so outside a space there is nothing to list — `moduleLaunchers`
 * would be showing whatever the last space happened to enable — and there is no space to open
 * settings for. Both of those keep their gate.
 *
 * The design pickers do not. Which template you are looking at is a question with an answer on the
 * spaces list too, and the chips could be reached there; gating the whole rail on a current dataset
 * would have quietly removed that.

          inside `--we-chrome-right` along with every module's panel — and a panel dragged away from
          this edge stops pushing the rail at all, which the summed version could not express.

          top edge, which this would otherwise sit inside — the vertical twin of the
          `--we-chrome-right` term above, and the same fix. `--we-panel-chrome-top` is chrome a
          module has declared at the top, which this rail can be walked into by a wide enough panel;
          the shell publishes it as zero when there is nothing up there, so nothing moves for
          nothing.

          A maximised panel is not among the collisions, and briefly was: this used to drop below its
          titlebar so it stayed reachable over the top of one. The rail hides instead — see `styles`
          below — because full screen means the app's own furniture is gone.

          The band is this rail's alone, which is why it is not folded into `--we-chrome-top`: every
          other piece of chrome is painted *below* the panels and so has nothing to dodge, and one
          that cleared 98px whenever any panel anywhere was open would be dodging nothing visible.

          shadow" — and it is the wrong one, because it belongs to the *tonal ladder*: the sequence
          page → card → popover, where each step is read against the one it covers. A popover has to
          clear the card underneath it, so the role lifts a full 10 lightness points. This rail
          covers nothing. It sits on the page, with air on both sides, and taking a ladder rung
          meant for occluding a card painted it 11 points lighter than everything around it — the
          washed-out grey strip that prompted this.

          Chrome is separated by *edge*, not by tone, which is what the border and the shadow are

          also what this rail always did (`neutral-50`, the page step), and the same choice the

          The call bar in @we/module-call does the same thing for the same reason; keep the two in
          step. A genuinely occluding surface — a menu, a select dropdown — still wants
