          and the Save button, to show one line each. Shown here, the same reading is available in
          the list itself, and expanding goes back to meaning "I want to edit this".

          Hidden while the row is open, because the editor below is then showing the same text.

          **The expansion check comes first, and must.** `$and` short-circuits, and only the
          expansion is reactive — `$member.hint` is a plain read off a row that mutates in place.
          Written the other way round, a row that mounts *without* a hint (every hand-added one)
          fails on the first operand, never reaches the store read, and so ends up a condition with
          no reactive dependency at all: it never re-evaluates, and the line can never appear however
          much is typed. Leading with the store read makes every toggle re-run this, which re-reads
          the hint as it now stands.

          Both transitions match `propertyDetail`'s: the two heights change in opposite directions on
          the same click, so without them the line vanishes in one frame while the panel eases open

          Icon first, name second: they are one identity pair (the models list below draws a shape

          copied, forked, synced from a peer — is only ever a candidate, and never starts writing
