/**
 * Which sections a space has, and which of them this agent bothers to see.
 *
 * Deliberately shaped like the Modules card beside it, down to the two switches per row and the
 * "For me" / "For everyone" captions — because it is the same question one tier up, and a page that
 * asked it twice in two different shapes would make the reader learn both. What differs is what
 * the answers mean: a module the community turns off is a capability nobody here runs, a section it
 * turns off is a page nobody here can navigate to.
 *
 * ## Why both answers on one row
 *
 * "The community removed this section" and "you hid it for yourself" are different situations with
 * different remedies, and one switch cannot tell them apart — it would sit in the "off" position for
 * two reasons and offer the same, wrong, fix for both. Side by side, the row says which.
 *
 * ## Why reordering lives here rather than in the nav
 *
 * Drag-to-reorder in the nav strip itself would be more direct, and wrong: the nav is what every
 * member sees, so a drag there is a community-wide change made by a gesture that reads as a personal
 * one. Here it sits under the heading that says who it affects, next to the switch that says the
 * same.
 */

/**
 * Why a section is not showing, when a switch alone would not say.
 *
 * One case only, and it is the one the layout cannot state for itself: a section the space *has*
 * that this agent has hidden. Its row sits above the divider with every other section the space has,
 * so without a word it reads as a section that should be in the nav and is not.
 *
 * The other case needs nothing — a section the space does not have is under a heading that says so.

                Two reasons it is not just an icon. `we-sortable` reads the attribute from the DOM,
                and a web component's props are assigned as properties — so the attribute on a
                `we-icon` would silently never exist. And without any handle at all the whole row is
                the grab area, which is wrong here: the row ends in two switches, so a press meant
                for one of them would start a drag, and a Space keypress would pick the row up
                rather than toggle.

                The button is what keeps the keyboard path open — Space on a focused handle picks
                the row up, exactly as it does on a plain item.

                      is over the button — so the carrier's `grab` was being answered by the hand
                      the button asks for. An explicit prop beats a default.

                      `:active` is exactly the span of a grab: held down is held on to. This is the
                      same grab → grabbing pair `we-move-handle` gives the panels, said in DS props
                      because this grip is a button rather than that primitive — `we-move-handle`
                      reports pointer movement of its own, which is a second claim on a press that
