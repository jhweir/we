/**
 * What this community has decided things mean — its reactions, its connections, its subjects, and
 * its models.
 *
 * The four are one act at different levels: naming what a reaction means, what a connection means,
 * what the conversation is *about*, and what a thing *is*. They sat together in the default
 * template's settings route and they stay together here, because a community reasoning about its own
 * vocabulary is reasoning about all of them at once.
 *
 * ## Why this section, alone, needs the space open
 *
 * Everything else on this page writes through an action that takes a space uuid, so it configures
 * whichever row you clicked. Vocabulary is read with `$query` and `shapeStore`, and both resolve
 * against the *current dataset* — there is no way to ask "the signal types of that other space"
 * without holding its dataset open, which joining does and clicking a row does not.
 *
 * So rather than pretend, it says so and offers the one thing that would fix it. Hiding the section
 * would be worse: a community that defined signal types in one space and cannot find them from
 * another has no way to tell a missing feature from a missing space.
