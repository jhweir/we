/**
 * A space's settings, docked beside the space rather than over it.
 *
 * ## Why a panel and not the settings overlay
 *
 * The chrome rail's gear used to call `openShellView('settings', '/spaces/<id>')` — which is to say
 * it opened *global* settings and then navigated, inside that overlay's own router, to the page for
 * the space you happened to be in. Everything about that read as an exit: the "Settings" heading and
 * its Account / Appearance / Spaces & data nav appeared, the space vanished behind a full-window
 * overlay, and the thing you were configuring was no longer on screen while you configured it.
 *
 * It was also the one surface that could not follow you. `navigateToSpace` closes shell views, so
 * walking to another space closed the settings you had open for the last one.
 *
 * A dock fixes all of that for free, because the host already owns it: drag and eight snap
 * positions, resize, float or displace, maximise, one close button on one titlebar, and a remembered
 * placement per device. Nothing here positions itself — see `docs/architecture/chrome-and-panels.md`.
 *
 * ## What it is *not*
 *
 * Not a second definition. The body is {@link spaceSettingsBody}, the same nodes the page in
 * Settings → Spaces & data renders, given the open dataset instead of a route segment. The page
 * stays, because configuring a space you are not standing in is a different act and the panel cannot
 * express it; see the docblock in `SpaceSettings.ts`.
 *
 * ## Modals from inside a panel
 *
 * Vocabulary opens modals — the model wizard, the signal-type form — and a panel is a `position:
 * fixed` box with `overflow: hidden` that becomes a containing block for fixed descendants the
 * moment it is floating and blurred. Every overlay primitive promotes itself into the browser's top
 * layer (`OverlayElement` calls `showPopover`) precisely so that cannot clip them, which is what
 * makes this tab usable in here at all.
 *
 * Named `.schema.ts` so `pnpm --filter @we/schema-shared validate` checks it. The validator walks
 * files by that name and descends into what they import, and nothing else imports this — a dock node
 * is reached from a registry, not from another schema — so under any other name a typo'd prop here
 * would show up only as part of a panel silently not rendering.
 */

/**
 * What the panel says when there is no space to configure.
 *
 * Reachable, and not only in theory: the rail's gear exists only inside a space, but the panel is
 * the user's to leave open, and the spaces list, a profile overlay or an embedded app all take the
 * current dataset away underneath it. An empty box would read as a panel that had broken.
 *
 * Said rather than self-closed. A panel that vanished when you walked out of a space would take its
 * position and size with it, and the way back would be a gear that is also no longer on screen —
 * whereas this recovers by itself the moment a space is open again.
