    `{ \"$\": \"item.name\" }`; the validator rejects the old string spelling", and the sections
    beneath it shipped `\"image\": \"$space.avatar\"`, `[\"$channel.name\"]` and a dozen more —
    documentation contradicting its own rule, in the file every AI-authored template copies from.
    An assistant following it is rejected and retries, burning continuations on the docs' own
    pattern.

    A regex over the finished reference rather than over the fragments, so it covers prose, examples
    and anything a generator interpolates — the three places it actually appeared.

    Matched only in a **value position**: an array element, or the right-hand side of a JSON key.
    The reference has to be able to name the mistake in order to forbid it — "a plain string in a
    prop is text too: `"$item.name"` renders those ten characters" is the rule, not a violation of
    it — and quoting it in a sentence is not a value position, so the two are told apart by where
    they sit rather than by an exception list.
