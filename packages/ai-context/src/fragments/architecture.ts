## Architecture Orientation (codebase work — not for JSON schema authoring)

### What WE is

WE is **social infrastructure that lets communities own their data and shape their own tools** —
the interface layer of a three-part stack: **WE** (design system + schema-driven UI + module
marketplace) on **AD4M** (data, meaning, agent coordination) on **Holochain** (trust/sync).

The core move: **the app is not the unit.** An experience is not compiled code — it's a
**template**: a JSON schema rendered live against a component registry. Because a template is
data rather than code, it is inspectable, forkable, safe to share from untrusted sources, and
editable by AI in place. Data lives separately, in AD4M perspectives the user owns, so changing
the interface never costs you your history.

Contributions form a ladder: most are **templates and themes** (authored in-browser, often
AI-assisted, no code). **Modules** (tokens → primitives → components → widgets, plus
blocks and feature modules) are the developer layer beneath — lower volume, but they raise the
ceiling on what every template above can express. A deployment is described by a **seed file**
(\`we-seed.json\`): which modules to include, how to arrange/theme them, platform settings.
(Flux is the reference application built on WE.) See VISION.md for the full rationale.

### Runtime: built on AD4M

WE's data layer is **AD4M** — an agent-centric, local-first, peer-to-peer meta-ontology.
Data is yours, stored locally and synced P2P (via Holochain) with no central server. The Solid
app (\`@we/app-shell\`, hosted by the web/electron/tauri targets) talks to an **AD4M executor**
(the ad4m runtime; \`@coasys/ad4m\` + \`ad4m-connect\`) that holds perspectives and syncs
neighbourhoods. Stores (\`sessionStore\`, \`datasetStore\`, \`spaceStore\`, …) expose reactive state to schemas.

AD4M is reached through the **backend contract** rather than directly: \`@we/backend-shared\` declares
the ports (\`DataSource\` + \`QueryAdapter\`, ephemeral, presence, transcription, model manifest) and
\`@we/backend-ad4m\` implements them. The renderer, the design system and the module contract never
import \`@coasys/*\` — which is why a template, a component or a feature module can be reasoned about
without knowing what holds the data.

Glossary (these terms pervade stores, models, and \`$query\`/\`perspective\` in schemas):
- **Agent / DID** — a user identity; addressed by a DID (\`sessionStore.me.did\`).
- **Perspective** — a local knowledge graph (links/triples). Each Space is backed by one;
  \`datasetStore.currentDataset\` is the active one, \`rootPerspective\` holds we-root models.
- **Neighbourhood** — a *shared* perspective, synced peer-to-peer. A shared Space is a neighbourhood.
- **SDNA (Social DNA)** — SHACL schemas installed into a perspective that define its data model.
  WE's models are SDNA-typed; \`initializeAsWeSpace\` installs WE's Space SDNA into a foreign perspective.
- **Expression / Language** — an AD4M content object addressed by a URL, stored/retrieved via a
  Language plugin (e.g. images go through FILE_STORAGE_LANGUAGE → an expression URL).
- **Model (Ad4mModel)** — WE's ORM over perspective links (\`Space.create\`, \`findAll\`, \`include\`, …);
  SDNA/SHACL-typed classes. See dev-patterns for CRUD conventions.

### Core product concepts

- **Space** — a community/context, backed by an AD4M perspective. *Personal* (local) or *shared*
  (a neighbourhood). Has a default template + theme.
- **Template** — a full UI **schema** (the JSON node tree). A Space renders a Template. Installable/shareable.
- **Theme** — token overrides + CSS layered over a template for visual identity. Installable/shareable.
- **Block** — a composable content unit (TextBlock, ImageBlock, EmbedBlock, …) authored via the block
  composer and stored as models. Blocks compose into posts/pages.
- **Signal** — a per-community reaction/vote. A \`SignalType\` (created per space) defines it; \`Signal\`
  instances attach to any \`WeNode\`.

Apps (\`apps/we-web\`, \`apps/we-electron\`, \`apps/we-tauri\`) are thin hosts over \`@we/app-shell\`.
Each supplies two things: a \`PlatformAdapter\` (where am I running) and a \`BackendConnector\`
(how do I reach the data layer).

**Dependency direction:** \`templates → shell → backend-shared ← backend-ad4m\`, and
\`modules → shell → backend-shared\`. Dependencies point inward toward the contract packages; there are
no sideways edges. \`@coasys/*\` may be imported by \`@we/backend-ad4m\`, \`@we/entities\`, and any module
that declares \`backends: ['ad4m']\` — nothing else. See \`docs/architecture/package-conventions.md\`.

### The Three Seams (why the layering holds)

1. **Primitives are the framework-neutral currency.** \`@we/primitives\` are Lit web components, so
   they render as plain custom-element tag strings in any framework. The schema renderer sets their
   props/events generically — no per-framework wrapper is needed for the render path. (Typed
   per-framework *declarations* are generated from the Custom Elements Manifest for hand-authored
   code — a DX layer, not a runtime one.)

2. **Schema semantics live in \`@we/schema-shared\`, parameterized by a reactivity port.** All token
   resolution (\`{ $ }\` expressions, \`$action\`, \`$query\`, \`$setLocal\`, …) is in \`propResolvers/\`.
   \`resolveProp(value, stores, context, memo)\` takes a framework-injected memoization function
   (\`memo\`), and \`markReactive()\` (see \`propResolvers/reactive.ts\`) tags accessors so a renderer
   knows a prop is reactive. The entire schema engine AND its reactivity wiring are framework-neutral;
   a framework only injects its signal primitive.

3. **The renderer is a thin per-framework adapter over a component registry.** \`@we/schema-solid\`
   walks the schema tree, resolves props with Solid's \`createMemo\` as \`memo\`, maps
   \`$each\`/\`$if\`/\`$routes\` onto \`<For>\`/\`<Show>\`/\`<Dynamic>\`, and mounts each node — a tag string
   for primitives, a registered component for layer-4/5. Adding a framework = a new adapter of this
   shape, NOT re-implementing the semantics.

### Render Pipeline (schema JSON → DOM)

1. A schema node has \`type\` (component/tag name), \`props\`, \`children\`, optional
   \`routes\`/\`slots\`/\`$localState\`/\`$queries\`.
2. Props are resolved by the shared dispatcher (\`propResolvers/dispatcher.ts\`): token objects
   (\`{ $ }\` expressions, \`$query\`, handlers) become values or reactive accessors via the injected \`memo\`;
   event-handler arrays resolve lazily at call time.
3. The renderer looks up \`type\` in the \`ComponentRegistry\` — a custom-element tag for
   \`@we/primitives\`, a framework component for \`@we/components\`/\`@we/widgets\`.
4. It mounts the node, binds resolved accessors as reactive props, wires custom events, and recurses
   into children. Block-level \`$\`-types (\`$each\`, \`$if\`, \`$single\`, \`$animate\`, \`$routes\`) map to the
   framework's control-flow primitives.

### Where to look

- Change how a token/operator resolves → \`packages/schema-system/shared/src/propResolvers/\`.
- Change tree-walking / mounting / control flow → \`packages/schema-system/frameworks/solid/src/\`.
- Add/adjust a primitive → \`packages/design-system/3-primitives/src/\` (Lit).
- Add/adjust a layout/composite component → \`packages/design-system/4-components/src/\` (Solid).
- DS-props → CSS logic (shared) → \`packages/design-system/utils/src/index.ts\`; Solid binding → \`.../src/solid/index.ts\`.
- Stores / app shell / registries → \`packages/app-shell/src/\`.
- Built-in templates (data) → \`packages/templates/\`.
- The editing surface → \`packages/editor/src/\`.
- The backend contract (ports, query IR) → \`packages/backend-system/shared/src/\`.
- AD4M wiring (query adapter, SDNA install, agent identity) → \`packages/backend-system/ad4m/src/\`.
- The feature-module contract → \`packages/module-system/shared/src/module.ts\`; a module → \`packages/module-system/<id>/\`.
- Data models (Space, blocks) → \`packages/entities/src/\` (see packages/entities/CONVENTIONS.md).
- A space's sections (views) → \`packages/templates/views/\`; how they resolve →
  \`packages/app-shell/src/shared/viewResolution.ts\` (see docs/architecture/views.md).
- Graph engine (expanders, layouts, expansion state) → \`packages/graph-system/\` (see its README);
  its data binding lives at \`packages/app-shell/src/frameworks/solid/components/GraphHost.tsx\`.
- App chrome and module panels (the sidebar, the module rail, floating vs displacing, who moves for
  whom) → \`packages/app-shell/src/shared/dockGeometry.ts\` (see docs/architecture/chrome-and-panels.md).

**Where a new thing goes** — module or host store, panel or fragment, who decides placement, and how
two capabilities cooperate without depending on each other — is
docs/architecture/capabilities-and-surfaces.md. Read it before adding a module, a panel or a store:
it is four rules, and half of it is the shapes that are refused on purpose.

For deeper detail (data sync/persistence, block & editor internals, the local dev/test loop),
see docs/architecture/codebase-map.md.
For how reusable template fragments work and where they are going, see
docs/architecture/template-fragments.md.

**A template is one of two things.** A *shell* owns a space's chrome, arrangement and route table;
a *view* renders one section inside one. \`meta.role\` says which, and absent means shell. A shell
marks where its sections go with \`{ path: '$views' }\` and the host expands that per space, from
\`Space.enabledViews\` (the community's list, and its order) minus \`SpacePreference.hiddenViews\`
(each agent's own). Do **not** hardcode a space's sections as routes, and do not write a nav strip
from a literal array — read \`spaceStore.viewNav\`, which is the same resolved list the routes are
built from. See docs/architecture/views.md.

**Before adding a relation between two models, read docs/architecture/relations.md.** A connection
can live in three places — a free-text label, a community-named \`RelationshipType\`, or a relation
declared on the model class — and they are not interchangeable. The short version: a declared
relation gets the full query surface and can carry nothing about itself (no author, no date, nothing
to comment on or rate); a reified one carries all of that and has no query pushdown at all. Declare
what is a fact about the *type*; reify what is a claim about a *pair*.

**Before changing anything about boards, read docs/architecture/boards.md.** A board's columns are
records, and a column is *a saved query with an arrangement*: what is in it comes from each task's
\`status\`, and the column's ordered \`children\` are only where the cards sit. That split is why work an
extraction pass writes appears on every board without anyone placing it, why deleting a column must
never delete its cards, and why the link state can be inconsistent after a partition and the board
still renders one answer. The same doc records where new per-column state goes, so the entity does
not accrete a scalar per feature.
