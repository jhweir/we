 * calling `useAiStore()` / `useTemplateStore()` / … directly — Solid context lookups into WE's shell,
 * which meant the editor could only ever run inside WE. Declared as a port instead, the editor
 * depends on a *shape*, and an application supplies it from whatever it already has: WE forwards its
 * stores, a third-party app forwards its own state, a test forwards plain signals.
 *
 * The surface is large because the editor genuinely drives a lot — it is an authoring tool, not a
 * widget. It is also honest: this is precisely the list an adopting application must satisfy, and
 * nothing is hidden behind an ambient import.
 *
 * Accessors are functions rather than values throughout, so the host chooses its own reactivity. WE
 * passes Solid accessors; nothing here names Solid's types.
