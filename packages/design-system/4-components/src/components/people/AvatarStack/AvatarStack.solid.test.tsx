/**
 * What a stack of faces claims about how many people there are.
 *
 * Every case here is a behaviour the component's own comments record as having gone wrong once, and
 * none of them had a test. They share a shape: the stack draws fewer faces than it was handed, and
 * the interesting question is always whether the number it reports is still true.
 *
 * Rendered rather than unit-tested because the dedupe and the cap are memos over props — extracting
 * them would test arithmetic that was never in doubt and skip the part that breaks, which is a memo
 * that stops following its input.
