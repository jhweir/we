 * grid-template-columns, Card's surface-opacity color-mix). Everything else —

 * the same answer the typography primitives give (see `BASE_TYPOGRAPHY_SPECS`). It inherits, so
 * setting it on the box also covers text these components hold directly: a bare string child, a
 * native `<p>` or `<span>` in a template, rendered block content. Without it, only text that
 * happened to be wrapped in `we-text` would break, which is the sort of half-fix that reads as
