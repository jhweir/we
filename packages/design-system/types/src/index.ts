 * same *places*; only `anywhere` also reduces the element's min-content width. A flex item and a
 * `1fr` grid track are both sized by min-content, so under `break-word` an unbreakable string still
 * pushes its container — and everything above it — wider than the viewport, which is precisely the
 * failure the default is here to prevent.
 *
 * `word-break: break-all` — break every word at the line edge, including ones that would have fit —
 * is deliberately not offered here. It is a different statement, right for a dense column of hashes
 * and wrong for prose, and on a bare identifier (which is what every site reaching for it in this
 * repo held) it renders identically to `anywhere`. The raw `styles` escape hatch remains for the

  /**
   * Values that take over from this width up — the responsive axis.
   *
   * A prop bag per tier, deliberately the same shape as `hoverProps` and friends, because it is the
   * same idea on a different axis: a partial set of props that applies under a condition. `*Props`
   * = partial-prop-bag is already a rule anyone reading a schema knows, and it keeps these
   * discoverable next to the states in the generated declarations.
   *
   * ```
   * { direction: 'column', gap: '300', mdUpProps: { gap: '500' } }
   * ```
   *
   * **Measured against the nearest surface, not the window.** A template renders inside a docked
   * panel, an editor preview pane and a phone, and the viewport is the wrong subject in two of
   * those. See `$surface`.
   *
   * Cascading-through is automatic: at `lg`, something set only in `smUpProps` still applies,
   * because each tier's declaration falls back through the one below it.
   *
   * ### Why `mdUpProps` and not `mdProps`
   *
   * `md` is already a *size* value on some fifteen primitives (`size="md"`), so `mdProps` reads as
   * "medium-size props". `Up` also settles the question every responsive system gets asked — whether
   * a tier means at-this-width or below-it — in the name, where it cannot be forgotten.
   *
   * ### Why states and tiers do not cross
   *
   * There is no `mdUpHoverProps`. Crossing them turns four states by four tiers into sixteen
   * prefixes of generated CSS on every component, to serve a case that is rare enough that nobody
   * here has wanted it yet. `*UpProps` sets base values at that width; `hoverProps` applies at all
   * widths.
   *
   * ### What a tier bag does *not* cover
   *
   * **`position`, `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` do not tier.** They typecheck here — the bag
   * is `Partial<DesignSystemProps>`, so it accepts every prop — and they are filtered out before
   * any variable is written, on both component families. `mdUpProps: { left: '300px' }` therefore
   * validates, renders, and does nothing at all.
   *
   * The exclusion is deliberate and shared with the state bags; see `POSITIONING_VAR_SUFFIXES` in
   * `@we/design-utils` for why. It is recorded here because that is a fact about the tier axis a
   * caller has no other way to learn: the type cannot express it, and the failure is silent.
   *
   * **Move something at a breakpoint with `x` / `y` / `rotate` instead.** They compose into
   * `transform`, which does tier — as do `width`, `height` and `zIndex`.
