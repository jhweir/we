    validated clean and did nothing — and `designSystemKeys`, which the Solid layout components use,
    includes tiers, which is why the one real usage in the repo happened to be on a layout node and
    happened to work.

    Text breaks rather than pushing its container off the screen — the design system's answer, not

    The fallback is what makes this a default: every typography component emits

    breakable line and one that sets `overflowWrap` overrides it.

    `anywhere` and not `break-word`, which is the value that looks right and does not work. The two
    break in the same places; only `anywhere` also reduces min-content width. A flex item and a
    `1fr` grid track are both sized by min-content, so under `break-word` one unbreakable
    string — a transcriber's run-together output, a DID, a pasted URL — still stretches its card,
    its grid track and the whole route sideways. That was the bug this default exists for.

    A default rather than a rule in each primitive's own stylesheet: the DS sheet is adopted last,

// with every DesignSystemProps field (not a hand-picked subset), because it's built from the
// exact same PropSpec tables Lit's we-* primitives already use for their own
// :host(:hover)/[part=base]:hover rules. bgImage-related keys are excluded — handled
// separately by the bg-image composite mechanism, not state-variance.
// ────────────────────────────────────────────

/*
  position/top/right/bottom/left are deliberately excluded: bgImage's overlay depends
  on `position: relative` being stable on the host, and an unset --we-ds-position would
  resolve to `static` (position isn't inherited), which could win the cascade over the
  bg-image rule's own position:relative depending on stylesheet order when both
  bgImage and hoverProps are set on the same element. Varying position by hover/active/
  focus state is a rare enough pattern that excluding it is the safer default.

  **This applies to the tier axis too**, because the tier bags go through the same
  `toInteractiveVars` + `buildStateFragmentStyles` pipeline the state bags do — so
  `mdUpProps: { left: '300px' }` typechecks and does nothing, exactly as `hoverProps: { top }`
  does. The rarity argument above is about states and does not obviously transfer: moving a
  thing at a breakpoint is the ordinary case, not a rare one.

  It stays excluded on both axes anyway, because the alternative is worse than the gap. Letting
  positioning into the tier vars and not the state vars means one list becoming two, a second
  `@container` arm per component, and the bg-image hazard re-opened for any element that sets a
  background image and a tier — to serve a case that already has a spelling that works on both
  axes and composes with rotation and scale: `x` / `y` / `rotate`, which are emitted as `transform`
  and so tier and state for free.

  What the exclusion must not do is stay unwritten. See `DesignSystemProps.mdUpProps`, which says
  so where somebody reaching for `mdUpProps: { left }` will read it.
