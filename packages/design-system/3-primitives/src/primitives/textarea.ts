      Vertical padding derived from the control height, so one row IS one control tall.

      It used to be a fixed 8px whatever the size, and that number is md's: a 40px control less a
      24px line box, halved. Every other size inherited md's padding and overshot — at sm, a 21px
      line inside 16px of padding is 37px in a row built for 32, so the box stood proud of the
      button beside it and min-height could do nothing about it, 37px of content being 37px tall.

      we-input never had this because a single-line field sets an explicit height and centres its
      text; its padding is decorative. A textarea's height is its content, so the padding is load
      bearing, and it has to follow the size like everything else does.

      The line box is 1em times the line-height ratio, which avoids the lh unit and its browser
      support question. max() guards the case where a theme's type is taller than its controls,
      where the honest answer is no padding rather than negative padding.

      Only the innermost fallback: a theme or a call site that sets padding still wins outright.

      still worth having — a zero-row textarea is a hairline — but it belongs at one row.

      It was then the md height whatever the size, which is the same bug one step smaller: a small
      textarea stood a few pixels taller than the small input and button beside it, and no amount of
      tuning at the call site could fix it, because the number came from a different size than the
      row was built at. Following the size — through the same expression we-input uses, theme offset

   * with the inputs and buttons beside it by construction rather than by matching numbers.
