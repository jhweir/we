/**
 * Every connected sortable, so a drag can find the zone under the pointer.

 * do not know about each other: a card leaving one column has no reference to the column it lands
 * in, and threading one through every template that composes a board would defeat the purpose.
 *
 * Membership is tied to connect/disconnect, so a zone removed mid-drag simply stops being a
 * candidate rather than leaving a stale rectangle behind.
 *
 * The registry itself is `@we/drag`'s, along with the ghost, the drop line, the top-layer
 * promotion and the press-to-drag threshold — the awkward parts, which this element solved first
 * and every other draggable surface would otherwise have solved again. **The zones stay its own**:
 * a sortable item carries an index within a list, which is not a reference to anything, so it is
 * not yet a session payload and a card cannot be dropped into a column. Moving that boundary is a
 * separate piece of work with its own consequences for what a drop means.

/**
 * A drop zone whose items can be picked up, reordered, and moved to other zones.
 *
 * ## One element, not two
 *
 * A zone *is* the container and its children *are* the items, which is what makes nesting free: a
 * sortable inside an item of another sortable is simply a zone inside a zone, with no special case
 * anywhere. A separate `we-drag-item` would buy nothing and cost boilerplate at every call site.
 *
 * ## It emits intent, it never mutates
 *
 * A drop fires {@link SortableMoveDetail} — "this item moved from there to here, at this index" —
 * and nothing else. What that *means* is the consumer's business, and it differs: a kanban route
 * keyed on `status` writes a scalar, a board built from containment relinks two `children` edges, an
 * outline reparents a node. A primitive that assumed one of those would be useless to the others.
 *
 * This is also why the element does not reorder its own DOM. The list is rendered from data; the
 * data changes; the list re-renders. A primitive that moved nodes itself would fight whatever
 * renders them.
 *
 * ## Nesting, and why cycles are not a problem
 *
 * The hard part of nested drag-and-drop is refusing to drop a container into its own descendant.
 * Because nesting here is expressed *in the DOM*, that check is `dragged.contains(zone)` — correct
 * by construction, needing no knowledge of the consumer's data shape. The innermost matching zone
 * under the pointer wins, so dropping into a nested list does not also count as dropping into its
 * parent.
 *
 * ## A zone that can be empty needs a size
 *
 * Hit-testing is by the zone's own bounding rectangle, so a zone holding nothing is a zero-height
 * rectangle and nothing can be dropped into it — which is precisely the zone a person most wants to
 * drop into. **Give any zone that can empty a `flex` or a `minHeight`**; without one the surrounding
 * box may look like the target while not being it, which is worse than looking undroppable.
 *
 * Left to the consumer rather than defaulted here, because how much room an empty list should hold
 * is a design decision and differs per surface — a kanban column reserves a trough, a reorderable
 * settings list should collapse. What the primitive owes is that the rule is written down where
 * somebody wiring one up will read it.
 *
 * ## Keyboard
 *
 * Space or Enter picks up the focused item; the arrow keys move it, along the list and across
 * zones; Space drops and Escape cancels. Built in rather than added later, because a board that can
 * only be operated by dragging is a board some people cannot operate at all — and because the
 * events are identical, a consumer gets it for nothing.
 *
 * ## Items that contain form controls: `[data-we-handle]`
 *
 * By default the whole item is the grab area, which is right for a card or a nav row. It is wrong
 * the moment an item contains a text field: dragging to select text would start a drag, and — worse
 * — the keyboard pickup would read a **space typed into an input** as "pick this up", so the field
 * could not accept spaces at all.
 *
 * So two rules, both no-ops for an item without form controls:
 *
 * - Mark one or more descendants `data-we-handle`, and only a press that begins inside a handle
 *   starts a drag. An item with no handle keeps dragging from anywhere, so existing consumers are
 *   unaffected.
 * - A Space or Enter that originates in a text-entry element (`input`, `textarea`, `select`,
 *   `contenteditable`, including inside a component's shadow root) is typing, never a pickup. This
 *   applies whether or not the item declares handles, because an unfocusable-by-design input that
 *   swallows spaces is a bug in every consumer that could hit it.
 *
 * Make the handle itself focusable (a `we-button` will do) so the keyboard path stays open: Space
 * on a focused handle picks the row up exactly as it does on a plain item.
 *
 * ## Overlays opened from an item are not part of it
 *
 * A press that begins inside an `OverlayElement` — a modal, a drawer, a popover — never drags the
 * item that overlay happens to sit inside, and no consumer has to declare anything for that.
 *
 * It is worth knowing why the case exists at all. A modal opened from a row is usually *declared* in
 * that row, because it needs the row's data to say what it is renaming; overlays are promoted to the
 * browser's top layer rather than reparented, so the sheet paints above the whole page while DOM
 * containment still says it is inside the row. Without this rule, dragging to select text in a rename
 * field dragged the column behind the modal.
 *
 * Same principle as nested zones, one layer up: the innermost thing under the pointer owns the
 * gesture. A sortable *inside* an overlay is unaffected — only the path between the press and the
 * item is considered.
 *
 * @fires moved - detail: {@link SortableMoveDetail}, on every completed move
 * @fires reorder - detail: string[] — the destination's order, fired only when an item stayed in
 *   its own zone. A specialisation of `moved` for the common single-list case, kept because that is
 *   what a reorderable sidebar wants and it would otherwise have to filter every cross-zone move.

      These do **not** bubble, for the reason `we-drop-zone`'s do not: the innermost sortable owns
      the drag, and that decision has to survive the DOM.

      Nesting is the whole point of the design — a sortable inside an item of another sortable is
      just a zone inside a zone — so an ancestor receiving its descendant's `reorder` is not an edge
      case, it is the ordinary arrangement. And the payload is *ids of the inner list*, which an
      outer handler will read as ids of its own: a kanban board whose columns are sortable and whose
      cards are sortable wrote three task ids into the board's own children on the first card
      reorder, and rendered them as three empty columns.

      Nothing loses anything by this. The event is dispatched on the host element, which is the
      element a consumer binds `onReorder` to; bubbling only ever offered it to somebody who should
      not have been listening.
