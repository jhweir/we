       with room reserved beneath it for descenders — space belonging to a font, in a box that may
       hold no text at all. Wrapping something whose height is its own (a row of avatars) in one
       therefore made the host taller than its content and pinned that content to the top of it: in
       a centred flex row the host centred, and the avatars rode high inside it, overflowing the
       trigger's box at the top.

       Flex boxes have no line boxes and no strut, so the wrapper stops contributing height of its
       own. The host stays inline-level, so a tooltip around a word in a sentence still flows. */

   * attribute**, so a component that declares one is sharing a name with a browser feature: the
   * value reflected to the host produced the browser's own native tooltip *as well as* this one —
   * two bubbles for one phrase, ours immediately and the browser's a second later, unstyled.
   *
   * Dropping the reflection was not enough to trust, either. An attribute set directly (which
   * hand-written JSX does for a custom element) brings the native tooltip straight back, and
   * nothing about that failure is visible from the call site. The only fix that cannot recur is to
   * stop squatting on the name.
   *
   * Not reflected: it is prose, and an attribute holding a sentence is noise in the inspector.
   * Slotted `content` overrides it, for a tooltip that is not a phrase — see `render`.
