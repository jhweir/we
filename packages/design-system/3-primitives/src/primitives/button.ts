    The confirming half of a yes/no pair — `danger`'s counterpart, and only that.

    ## When it earns its place, and when `primary` is still right

    Reach for it where a screen asks a **binary** question and the two answers sit side by side:
    keep or discard a suggestion, approve or refuse a request. It is not "the important button" and
    it is not a louder `primary` — a form's Save is `primary`, however positive saving feels. Used
    that way a status colour becomes an emphasis level, and the vocabulary stops meaning anything.

    ## Why not `primary` for the yes

    `accent` is the *brand* colour. A theme may legitimately set it to anything, including something
    close to `danger`, at which point the two answers to a yes/no question read as the same kind of
    thing. `success` is semantic, so a theme that keeps roles meaning what they say keeps this
    readable. That is the same argument the `danger` note below makes from the other side: a status
    fill deserves a role, so a theme can say something about it beyond its hue.

    ## The colour is never the whole message

    Green and red are the classic pair to fail on, which is why `we-alert` carries a glyph per
    variant. A confirm/refuse pair built from these two must pair them with icons or words that say
    the same thing — the colour is the fast path for people who can use it, never the only one.

    Nothing new was needed underneath: `success`, `on-success`, `successHover` and `successActive`
    all exist, and `success` is in FILL_LABELS, so its label is derived and contrast-corrected
    exactly as `danger`'s is.

    On the `danger` role, which exists now.

    It was on the scale for a long time, with a comment arguing that a status fill had no role and
    that `danger-500` stayed themeable through `dangerHue`. That was true and not enough: it meant a
    theme could restyle the primary button completely and could not say anything about the
    destructive one beyond its hue. Hover and pressed stay on the scale deliberately — they are
    steps *from* the fill, and giving each its own role would add two more things to keep in sync
    for a state nobody themes separately.

      because a Select trigger and a field sit in the same row and must answer focus the same way.

      double up on, and both spellings land on 2px of accent.

      The ring is restated rather than inherited: `mergeProps` is a shallow spread, so a variant's
