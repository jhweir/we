    touch-action is a property of a box, and display:contents generates none — so this declaration
    sat on :host doing nothing at all, and every Pocket row and kit card picked up on long-press and
    dropped itself the moment the finger moved, because the UA was free to start a native pan and
    fire pointercancel. The wrapper cannot become a box (a card inside a grid track would then take
    the track and lay out against the wrapper instead of the grid), so the rule moves down to what
    is actually being dragged.

    pan-y rather than none: a finger must still be able to scroll a feed of draggable cards. The
    drag is a long press, and pointerDrag blocks the scroll for the duration of the drag itself —
    which is the half CSS cannot express, since the decision is made after the press.

/**
 * Makes whatever is inside it something that can be picked up and carried somewhere else.
 *
 * ## Why this exists as a primitive
 *
 * A post card, a member row and a space in the sidebar are rendered by **templates**, which are
 * data. If making one draggable were a code change, every future draggable surface would be a code
 * change too, and the contribution ladder says arrangement stays data. This is the same rung
 * `we-sortable` occupies: two custom elements and an existing `$action`, with no new prop resolver,
 * no new operator, and nothing added to the expression grammar.
 *
 * ```json
 * { "type": "we-draggable",
 *   "props": { "entity": "CollectionBlock", "recordId": { "$": "post.id" }, "label": { "$": "post.title" } },
 *   "children": [ "…the card…" ] }
 * ```
 *
 * ## What it carries
 *
 * A **reference** — `{ dataset?, entity, id }` — never DOM, and never the row object. `dataset` is
 * deliberately left empty here: a card fragment cannot name its own dataset without reading a
 * store, and portable fragments name no store by construction. The receiver stamps it, from
 * whichever dataset was current when the drop happened.
 *
 * ## `display: contents`
 *
 * The wrapper must not exist as a box. A card inside a grid track, a row inside a flex column: a
 * real element in between would take the track and leave the card laid out against the wrapper
 * instead of the grid. What is dragged is therefore the *child*, which is also what the ghost and
 * the geometry are measured from.
 *
 * @fires we-drag-begin - detail: the DragItem, when a drag actually starts (not on the press)
