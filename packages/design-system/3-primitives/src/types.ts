  How loud a badge is, orthogonal to what it means.

  `variant` says which meaning — neutral, success, danger — and this says how much of the screen it
  takes: `soft` is the tinted panel pair (`success-surface` on `success-text`), `solid` is the fill
  and its measured label (`success` on `on-success`). Every design system with a badge ends up with
  both axes, because "the connection is degraded" and "WE ARE RECORDING" are the same meaning at
  different volumes, and one appearance cannot serve both.

  Two values rather than the three most libraries offer: `outline` has no caller here yet, and the
  bar for a third is a real use, not symmetry with somebody else's table.

  The same axis on an alert, and deliberately not the same two values.

  A badge is small enough that a fill is the loud option; an alert is a panel, so its fill would be
  the loudest thing on the page and there is no caller for one. What an alert needs instead is a
  *quieter* option than the tint — a column of pending items where eight tinted panels compete with
  each other and with everything around them. `accent` is that: the status as a thick left edge on
  an ordinary surface, which is Chakra's `left-accent` and Material's list-leading rule.

  across ~38 call sites — and that is not eleven needs, it is three needs and eight guesses. A
  modal is read at a glance (`sm`), filled in (`md`), or worked in (`lg`); `fullscreen` is the
  lightbox case, where the content is the size and the sheet gets out of its way. Offering `xs`
