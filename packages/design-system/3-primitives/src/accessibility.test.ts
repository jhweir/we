/**
 * An axe pass over the primitives that carry a role, so accessibility is a number rather than an
 * impression.
 *
 * The 2026-09-05 audit could say only that 224 `aria-*`/`role=` attributes appear in this package,
 * which is evidence that somebody was thinking about it and no evidence at all that the result is
 * right. Nothing in the 252 test files asserted anything about it. This file is the smallest thing
 * that turns that into a measurement.
 *
 * ## What jsdom can and cannot answer, and why the rule set is narrowed
 *
 * axe's rules divide into ones that read the accessibility tree and ones that need layout or paint.
 * jsdom builds the first and none of the second: every rect is zero and no style is computed, so
 * `color-contrast` cannot run at all, and the target-size and reflow rules would report against
 * geometry that does not exist. Leaving them enabled would produce either noise or — worse — a
 * green result that looks like it covered contrast when it did not.
 *
 * So this asserts what is genuinely checkable here: that an interactive primitive exposes a role,
 * that it has an accessible name, that the ARIA it sets is valid and permitted for that role, and
 * that required parent/child relationships hold. Those are real bugs and the common ones.
 *
 * **Contrast is still unmeasured.** `@we/themes` computes foreground colours against their
 * backgrounds at apply time and has 431 tests over that arithmetic, which is a stronger guarantee
 * than a spot check would be — but it is a different guarantee, and neither it nor this file is a
 * substitute for running axe against a real browser. Treat a green run here as "the semantics are
 * sound", not as "the design system is accessible".
