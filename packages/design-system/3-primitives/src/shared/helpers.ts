  A state may take time to arrive. It must not take time to leave.

  ## What the flicker actually was

  Hovering across a list of buttons produced an occasional glitch that survived four rounds of
  instrumentation — zero dropped frames, zero long tasks, every individual transition textbook. It was
  finally isolated by building nine variants of the same list, each differing in one property, and
  the result had no exceptions: **every variant with a hover-*out* fade flickered, and every variant
  without one was clean.** `transition: none` was clean; fade-in-with-instant-out was clean; and
  instant-in-with-fade-out — which changes nothing about how the highlight appears — flickered as
  badly as the original. A single button on its own could not be made to flicker at all.

  So the mechanism is the trail. A pointer crosses one of these buttons in 40–70ms, measured; with a
  fade on the way out, each button keeps painting a decaying highlight after the pointer has gone, and
  one or two ghosts sit lit behind the cursor at any moment, appearing and vanishing in sequence. No
  single transition is wrong, which is exactly why nothing that examined transitions one at a time
  ever found anything.

  Stated as a rule: a hover indicator exists to say *the pointer is here*. Any persistence after the
  pointer leaves is the indicator asserting something false about somewhere it isn't. Arrival can be
  animated, because the statement is becoming true. Departure cannot, because it has already stopped
  being true.

  ## Why there are two declarations

  These properties are also what cross-fades when the theme changes, and that transition is wanted —
  it is the only thing making a light/dark switch feel like one event rather than a repaint. But it is
  a different job from state feedback, on a different timescale, and CSS gives us exactly one
  `transition` per rule to express both.

  The split falls out of where each rule applies. `STATE_TRANSITION` goes on the `:hover`/`:focus`/
  `:active` rules, which govern the animation *into* those states — the arrival. `REST_TRANSITION`
  goes on the base rule, which governs the animation back *out* of them — the departure — and so
  resolves to `0s` and snaps. A theme switch mutates custom properties while the base rule is the one
  matching, so it reads the same declaration; `--we-theme-switch-duration` is raised for the duration
  of the switch (see `applyThemeVars`) and lowered again, which buys the cross-fade back without ever
  putting a duration on a hover exit. Custom properties inherit through shadow boundaries, so one
  value on the root reaches every primitive.

  ## Why the arrival is 50ms

  Not because of interruption, which is the intuitive answer and is wrong. Back when both directions
  still faded, 150ms flickered *less* than 50ms — the opposite of what a theory about interrupted
  transitions predicts, and reason enough to discard it. Once departures snap the constraint reverses,
  and the measurement is unambiguous:

      over   -624
             -603   18% faded
             -588   34% faded
      out    -577
             -571    0%          ← snapped off at a third

  A pointer crosses one of these buttons in 40-70ms. With a 150ms arrival that buys about a third of
  the fade, so a quick pass lights the button dimly and then removes it — a partial state that
  appears and aborts, which reads as a glitch precisely because it never resolved into anything. With
  a 50ms arrival and `ease-out` the same pass is essentially complete, so it reads as a highlight
  that came and went.

  So the rule has a second half. A state may take time to arrive — but not more time than the gesture
  that triggers it, or the arrival never finishes and the user is shown a fraction of an answer. That
  makes the ceiling here a measured property of pointing at a small target, not a matter of taste.

  `ease-out` matters for the same reason at the margin: it front-loads the change, so the shortest
  hovers still land most of it.

  ## Why the text does not animate at all

  Even with both of the above right, the flicker persisted — and every number said it should not.
  Every transition was textbook, no two buttons were ever lit at once, the interpolation sat exactly
  on its line, the geometry never moved, and a full computed-style diff showed hovering changed
  `background-color`, `color`, and eighteen aliases of `color`, and nothing else.

  What settled it was noticing that every control which had tested clean changed the background
  *alone*. Adding a text-colour change to the clean shape, with nothing else different, brought the
  flicker back at roughly a hundred times the rate; removing the text entirely left it clean. So
  `color` leaves the state list — see the note on `THEME_FADE_PROPS` — and keeps its place in the
  theme fade, where it is the point rather than a side effect.

  What remains after that is a residual on the order of one percent, present on a plain `<button>`
  with hand-written CSS and no framework of any kind. That one is the browser's, and the honest thing
  is to say so rather than keep changing the design system in front of it.
