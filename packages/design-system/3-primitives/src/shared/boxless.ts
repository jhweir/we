/**
 * The one thing a boxless wrapper cannot do, said out loud.
 *
 * `we-draggable` and `we-tooltip` are `display: contents`: they decorate a child with behaviour and
 * must not take part in their parent's layout, or they steal the grid track the child should have
 * had, become the flex item the child should have been, and absorb stretch alignment. That decision
 * is argued on each of them.
 *
 * The cost is that a `display: contents` element generates no box at all, so every geometry prop on
 * it resolves to nothing. Not "to a default" — to nothing: the declaration is written, the property
 * applies to a box that was never generated, and the element renders exactly as it would have
 * without it. Which is the silent failure this codebase keeps hunting: it validates, it typechecks,
 * it renders, and it does not work.
 *
 * It is also an easy mistake to make honestly. Before `we-tooltip` was boxless, the wrapper *was*
 * the flex item, so the sidebar header put its width and flex on the tooltip — correctly, at the
 * time. Anything written in that period is now inert, and nothing else would ever have said so.
 *
 * A warning rather than a fix: the right answer is to move the prop to the child, and only the
 * author knows which child. Dev-only, once per element, in the shape `warnAboutSmil` established.
 */

/**
 * Props that need a box to mean anything.
 *
 * Geometry and painting, not behaviour: `onClick` and `cursor` are fine on a boxless host, since
 * the events come from the child either way. Kept explicit rather than derived from the DS layer
 * lists, because the question here is "does this need a box", which is not what a layer answers —
 * `overflow` is a layout prop and equally inert, while `pointerEvents` is a layout prop that still
 * works through the child.
