# Tokens — Design Conventions

Rules and patterns for adding or modifying design tokens in `@we/tokens`.

## What Is a Token?

A token is a **named design value with a curated scale** that generates CSS custom properties (`--we-*`). If a value set is just standard CSS keywords (e.g. `display: flex | block | grid`), it's a **type**, not a token — those belong in `@we/design-types`.

**Rule of thumb:** If there's a value map → token (`@we/tokens`). If it's a CSS keyword union → type (`@we/design-types`).

## File Structure

Each token category lives in its own source file under `src/`:

| File           | Tokens                                                 | CSS Prefix                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `color.ts`     | Color hues, lightness, base colors                     | `--we-color-*`                                       |
| `space.ts`     | Spacing scale                                          | `--we-space-*`                                       |
| `font.ts`      | Font family, size, weight, line-height, letter-spacing | `--we-font-*`                                        |
| `size.ts`      | Component sizes, radius, avatar sizes                  | `--we-size-*`, `--we-radius-*`, `--we-avatar-size-*` |
| `border.ts`    | Border width, color                                    | `--we-border-*`                                      |
| `shadow.ts`    | Shadow scale (the one components use via `shadow=`)    | `--we-shadow-*`                                      |
| `role.ts`      | Semantic role slots over the scale                     | `--we-role-*`                                        |
| `layout.ts`    | Layout measure widths                                  | `--we-layout-*`                                      |
| `z-index.ts`   | Stacking layers                                        | `--we-z-*`                                           |
| `animation.ts` | Transition durations                                   | `--we-transition-*`                                  |
| `component.ts` | Component-specific tokens (scrollbar)                  | `--we-scrollbar-*`                                   |

All files are re-exported through `src/index.ts`.

## Naming Conventions

### Scale Types

- **Numbered scales** (`'100'`–`'1000'`) — for continuous/metric values where relative ordering matters: spacing, font-size, radius, transition duration.
- **Named scales** (`'sm'`, `'md'`, `'lg'`) — for semantic/categorical values: component sizes, shadow presets.
- **Keyword scales** (`'tight'`, `'normal'`, `'loose'`) — for named presets with descriptive meaning: line-height, letter-spacing.
- **Special named tokens** (`'pill'`, `'full'`) — non-linear values that don't fit a numeric scale, used alongside numeric scales (e.g. radius).

### Type Naming

Every token category exports up to two types:

```ts
// The token type — only valid scale values, gives autocomplete
export type SpaceToken = '0' | '100' | '200' | ... | '1000';

// The value type — token + escape hatch for raw CSS
export type SpaceValue = SpaceToken | (string & {});
```

| Suffix   | Purpose                              | Example                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `*Token` | Strict union of scale values         | `SpaceToken`, `FontSizeToken`, `RadiusToken` |
| `*Value` | Token + `(string & {})` escape hatch | `SpaceValue`, `ColorValue`, `RadiusValue`    |

**When to add an escape hatch (`*Value` type):**

- The property might reasonably need a raw CSS value (e.g. `padding="clamp(1rem, 2vw, 2rem)"`)
- The token scale can't cover all valid use cases (e.g. shadow, line-height)
- Other similar tokens already have one (consistency)

**When NOT to add an escape hatch:**

- The token + keyword union already covers all valid CSS values (e.g. `FontWeight = FontWeightToken | 'bold' | 'normal' | ...`)

### Value Map Naming

```ts
// Named same as the CSS property / token category
export const space = { ... };
export const fontSize = { ... };
export const fontWeight = { ... };
```

Use `satisfies Record<TokenType, string>` to enforce completeness:

```ts
export const lineHeight = {
  none: '1',
  tight: '1.25',
  normal: '1.5',
} satisfies Record<LineHeightToken, string>;
```

## Adding a New Token

1. **Define the token type** in the appropriate `src/*.ts` file.
2. **Define the value map** — a `Record<TokenType, string>` with `satisfies`.
3. **Add a Value type** if an escape hatch is needed (see rules above).
4. **Export** types and values from `src/index.ts`.
5. **Update CSS generation** in `scripts/generate-css.ts` to produce `--we-{prefix}-{key}` variables.
6. **Update helpers** in `@we/design-utils` or `@we/primitives` `helpers.ts` to call `tokenVar(prefix, value)` for the new token.
7. **Update `DesignSystemProps`** in `@we/design-types` to reference the new type.

## CSS Generation

The `scripts/generate-css.ts` script runs as a post-build hook (via tsup). It:

1. Imports compiled token maps from `dist/index.js`
2. Generates per-category CSS files in `dist/css/`
3. Creates `dist/css/index.css` as an aggregator with `@import` statements

**Naming rule:** CSS custom properties follow `--we-{category}-{key}`, e.g.:

- `--we-space-300`
- `--we-color-primary-500`
- `--we-font-size-400`
- `--we-radius-400`

## Roles vs scale positions

`color.ts` holds the **scale** — `neutral-0` … `neutral-1000`, one ramp per hue. `role.ts` holds the
**vocabulary**: `surface`, `text-muted`, `border`, `accent-text`, `danger-text`. A scale position says
which grey; a role says what the colour is _for_.

**Anything with a meaning takes a role.** Every `bg`, `color` and border colour in a template, in the
app chrome and in a feature module names a role, and `tokenVar('color', …)` resolves role names to
`--we-role-*` exactly as it resolves scale positions to `--we-color-*`, so they are interchangeable
at every call site — including inside a border shorthand and behind `$if`.

Two reasons it matters, and only the second is obvious:

1. A role is what a theme can redefine. `ThemeOverrides.roles` pins any of them; the theme editor
   exposes all of them.
2. Some relationships **invert** between light and dark and a scale position cannot express that,
   because the whole ramp flips together. A raised surface gets _lighter_ in dark rather than
   casting a shadow; a rail that must stay darker than its page in both modes cannot be written as
   `neutral-100` over `neutral-50`. This is the reason roles exist, not a nicety.

**Scale positions remain right for a palette** — a graph's node colours by category, a chart series,
a user-picked swatch. A node painted `warning-100` because it is a note is not a warning, and
nothing about a theme should recolour it as one. Those are the only scale positions left in the
templates, deliberately.

Colours may be written in `oklch()` anywhere a colour is accepted; it is parsed and converted to
sRGB like any other notation. The _ramps_ are still HSL — moving those is a separate decision that
changes how every theme looks — but an author pasting a value from a modern palette tool should not
be told it is unparseable, and OKLCH is the space in which a contrast check would like to reason.

When adding a role, give it a parametric default over the scale so every existing theme keeps
working untouched, and say in its doc comment what relationship it exists to express — if the answer
is only "a slightly different grey", it is a scale position and does not belong here.

### Four ways to pin one, and what each survives

A theme overrides a role by giving it a value, and _which kind_ of value decides how much of the
theme still reaches it afterwards. In descending order of how much survives:

| Written as                                                                                                      | Survives                                                         | Use for                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| unset                                                                                                           | everything                                                       | the default; the role follows the scale                                |
| `var(--we-color-neutral-200)`                                                                                   | hue, saturation, light/dark polarity                             | "surfaces sit two steps down" — most theme edits mean this             |
| `oklch(22.7% calc(min(var(--we-color-neutral-saturation) * 0.0035, 0.18) * 0.454) var(--we-color-neutral-hue))` | hue and saturation; holds its lightness against a polarity flip  | a designed theme whose surface ramp is uneven — `channels`, `timeline` |
| `color-mix(in srgb, var(--we-role-surface) 88%, var(--we-role-text))`                                           | everything, _including a later change to the role it references_ | "a step darker than the surface" — a relationship rather than a value  |
| `oklch(from var(--we-role-page) calc(l + 0.045) c h)`                                                           | the same, and stays an even step at any lightness or hue         | "one step above the page" — how the elevation stack is written         |
| `#1a1a1e`                                                                                                       | nothing                                                          | a brand colour that must not move                                      |

The two relative rows are worth reading twice: they are the only forms that express a _relationship_
rather than a value, so it survives a change to the role it names — and because it mixes toward a
role that inverts with the theme, "a step darker" in a light theme becomes "a step lighter" in a
dark one without being told. The secondary button's hover and pressed states are written this way,
which is why they need no roles of their own.

The `oklch(from …)` row is the stronger of the two and is why the elevation stack is written that
way. `color-mix` interpolates _between two colours_, so a fixed percentage moves by a share of the
distance remaining — 8% toward white is 0.4 lightness points from a near-white page and 7 from a
dark one. `calc(l + n)` in OKLCH moves by a fixed _perceptual_ amount instead, which is the only
thing that means the same in a light theme and a dark one. It also carries `c` and `h` through, so
a theme that tints its neutrals gets a tinted stack without saying so.

The ramp itself is OKLCH too, for the same reason at a different scale. Under HSL a step was a
_coordinate_, so the same "500" landed at L* 46 for blue and L* 69 for green — a 39-point swing
across the hue slider at one nominal step, which meant changing a hue silently changed how heavy the
accent read, and the three status _text_ roles had to sit at three different steps to compensate.
They share one step now.

> author-facing version of this. What follows is the reasoning underneath it.

### What a theme states

    polarity           'light' | 'dark'   — which end the ramp counts from
    lightnessFloor     '12%'              — the darkest lightness this theme uses
    lightnessCeiling   '112%'             — the lightest; may exceed 100, which clamps at white
    saturation         0–100              — the fraction of the chroma this hue can actually hold

The floor and ceiling are also the contrast control: a narrow span is a soft theme, a full one is
stark. They replaced `multiplier` (only ever ±1 — a boolean typed as a number) and `subtractor`
(which meant "reflect and offset", and could only be understood by dragging it).

Two consequences worth knowing when writing a theme by hand:

- **A hue is an OKLCH angle**, which is not the HSL angle for the same colour — 220 (blue) is 263,
  and 45 (amber) is 90. `migrate.ts` converts stored themes; a number typed fresh is an OKLCH angle.
- **Saturation is a fraction of what the hue can hold**, measured per theme rather than capped at a
  constant. sRGB holds very different amounts by hue — at mid lightness a violet reaches chroma
  0.259 and a teal 0.103 — so a flat ceiling made one number mean different things depending on
  where the hue slider was. 100 means "as colourful as this hue gets".

### Two scales, and what each actually moves

`fontScale` and `spacingScale` are separate controls, but not symmetrically. The space steps are in
`rem` and `fontScale` sets the root font size, so **type carries spacing with it** and only the
reverse is independent: you can make a layout denser without shrinking the text, not the other way
round. That is deliberate rather than unfinished — rem-based spacing is what respects a reader's own
font-size preference, and cutting that tie to gain symmetry would trade an accessibility property
for a tidier API. To scale type alone, set both.

There is no `radiusScale` to match them, also deliberately: radius does not scale usefully by a
ratio — doubling a 2px radius and a 16px one produces two different design decisions — which is why
shape is offered as four groups and a set of presets instead.

### Wide-gamut displays

The ceiling is measured against Display P3 when the screen reports it, and sRGB otherwise. That is
worth ~36% more chroma for a green and ~34% for a teal, and it costs nothing on an older display —
the ceiling is simply where it always was. Deliberately not a `@media (color-gamut: p3)` block: the
ceiling depends on the theme's hue, which CSS cannot compute, so a static block could only carry a
flat number — the exact thing per-hue normalisation exists to remove.

### Colour-vision deficiency

Red and green at the same lightness are the same colour to about one man in twelve, and no choice of
hue fixes that for a palette built on red and green. The standard (WCAG 1.4.1) asks for redundancy
rather than separability, and that is what the system provides: every status variant carries its own
icon, asserted in `@we/primitives` beside the component that provides it.

The theme editor _reports_ when a theme's `danger` and `success` converge under deuteranopia, as
advice rather than a failure — an author dragging `successHue` toward `dangerHue` is making it worse
with no other feedback.

### Components the design system does not ship

A feature module can register its own components into the theme cascade with
`registerComponentCascade(name, { radiusGroup, paddingGroup, gapGroup })`, so a theme that squares
off its surfaces reaches them too. Call it before the component first renders; the cascade is read
while a component's styles are built, and a later registration has no effect on what is already on
screen. Without this a module's only options were to borrow a core group whose meaning did not fit
or to hardcode — and a hardcode is invisible to every theme written afterwards.

### Contrast is checked twice

WCAG 2 **and** APCA, with the stricter governing. WCAG 2 stays because it may be the compliance
obligation; APCA is there because WCAG 2 adds a flat 0.05 to both sides of its ratio, which
dominates the denominator against a near-black background — so dark themes score far better than
they read. Every dark built-in passed WCAG 2 and failed APCA.

Which is why six foregrounds are **derived rather than pinned**: `textMuted`, `textFaint`,
`accentText` and the three status texts keep their hue and walk their lightness away from their
background until they clear. A fixed step cannot serve both polarities — the step that reads in the
dark is wrong in the light — and pinning one per theme is what the derivation replaced.

A filled control (`accent`, `danger`, `success`, `warning`) has to sit **away from the middle of its
theme's ramp**, or no label reads on it at either end. Where the middle falls depends on the range,
which is why two themes pin their way out of it.

The last row is the only one that really leaves the system, and it is the one a colour picker
produces by default — which is why `we-color-picker` opens on the **token grid** when `tokens` is
set, and why the theme editor names the rung each role is on rather than showing a swatch and
leaving you to guess.

Two roles are deliberately written the third way in `role.ts` itself: `surfaceInverse` and
`onInverse`. A tooltip has to stay opposite to the page in _both_ polarities, and no expression
over the scale can do that, because the whole ramp inverts together.

## Runtime Consumption

Tokens are consumed at runtime via two mechanisms in `@we/design-utils`:

### `tokenVar()` — for most props

```ts
tokenVar('space', '300'); // → 'var(--we-space-300)'
tokenVar('color', '#ff0000'); // → '#ff0000' (raw CSS passthrough)
tokenVar('space', undefined); // → '0' (fallback)
```

Raw CSS values (hex, px, rem, %, rgba, `auto`, `none`, etc.) are detected by `isRawCSSValue()` and passed through unchanged. Named tokens become CSS variable references.

Use `tokenVar()` when raw CSS values for that prop are **syntactically distinguishable** from token keys — i.e. they contain units, `#`, `var()`, or known keywords. This covers `color`, `space`, `fontSize`, `radius`, `letterSpacing`, `shadow`, etc.

### `makeTokenResolver()` — for ambiguous props

Some props have token keys that are syntactically identical to valid raw CSS values (bare numbers, CSS keywords without units). `isRawCSSValue()` cannot distinguish them, so `tokenVar()` would silently generate a non-existent CSS variable.

For these props, use `makeTokenResolver()` to build a dedicated resolver that checks the exact set of valid token keys:

```ts
// In utils/src/index.ts:
const resolveLineHeight = makeTokenResolver(
  new Set(['none', 'tight', 'snug', 'normal', 'relaxed', 'loose']),
  'line-height',
);
// resolveLineHeight('normal')  → 'var(--we-line-height-normal)'
// resolveLineHeight('1.6')     → '1.6'   (raw passthrough)
// resolveLineHeight('2')       → '2'     (raw passthrough — works, unlike tokenVar)
// resolveLineHeight('24px')    → '24px'  (raw passthrough)
```

**Current props using `makeTokenResolver`:**

| Prop         | Token keys                                            | Why not tokenVar?                                                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `lineHeight` | `none`, `tight`, `snug`, `normal`, `relaxed`, `loose` | Bare number ratios (`1.6`, `2`) are indistinguishable from integer token keys  |
| `fontWeight` | `'100'`–`'900'`                                       | CSS keywords (`bold`, `normal`, `bolder`, `lighter`) are strings without units |

**Rule:** Any new token prop whose raw CSS escape hatch values are bare strings or numbers (no units, no `#`, no `var()`) should use `makeTokenResolver` instead of `tokenVar`.
