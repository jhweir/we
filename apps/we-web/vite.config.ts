      Above the flat 500 kB default, deliberately.

      Four chunks crossed it, and three are third-party viewer libraries already behind a dynamic
      import: Cesium (~3.17 MB, as `src-*` and `SkyBox-*`) and three.js (~605 kB, as `WeCube-*`),
      each fetched the first time a template draws a globe or the cube. Rollup's limit is per-chunk
      and cannot tell a deferred chunk from the entry, so it reported all four on every build — and
      the fix it recommends, `import()`, was already taken for three of them.

      Set just above Cesium, so this still fires if a vendor chunk grows by a third.

      The cost is the fourth: the eager entry chunk (~2.48 MB, 674 kB gzipped, mostly
      `@coasys/ad4m`) is now under the limit as well. Nothing was guarding that number before —
      the warning had fired on every build for long enough to be read as noise — but if it should
      be, it wants a budget measured over the entry's static import graph, not a per-chunk ceiling.
